<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<p>To be easily assimilated, our mental food, like our
physical food, should be carefully chosen and attractively
served.</p>

<p>The history of the "Dark and Bloody Ground"
teems with adventure and patriotism. Its pages are
filled with the great achievements, the heroic deeds,
and the inspiring examples of the explorers, the settlers,
and the founders of our state. In the belief that
a knowledge of their struggles and conquests is food
that is both instructive and inspiring, and with a
knowledge that a text on history does not always
attract, the author sets before the youth of Kentucky
these stories of some of her great men.</p>

<p>This book is intended as both a supplementary
reader and a text, for, though in story form, the chapters
are arranged chronologically, and every fact recorded
has been verified.</p>

<p>Thanks are due to the many friends who have
granted access to papers of historical value, to many
others who have assisted in making this book a reality,
and especially to my husband, Dr. Clyde Edison
Purcell, for his valuable suggestions, careful criticisms,
and untiring coöperation.</p>

<h1>STORIES OF OLD KENTUCKY</h1>



<p><br /><br /><br /></p>
<h2><a name="WHEN_THE_OCEAN_COVERED_KENTUCKY" id="WHEN_THE_OCEAN_COVERED_KENTUCKY"></a>WHEN THE OCEAN COVERED KENTUCKY</h2>


<p>Facts are stranger than fiction; and when we read
the great volume of Nature, we find it more intensely
interesting, instructive, and exciting than any "tale"
told by our master minds.</p>

<p>It is difficult enough for the youth of to-day to
realize there was ever a time when Kentucky did not
have a place on the map and in the march of events.
Still more difficult is it for them to realize that there
was a time when the ocean covered our state. Geological
annals show that the surface of Kentucky was
once the bed of the sea. This primitive ocean is
supposed to have covered a large part of North America
to the depth of several thousand feet. As we read
the record in the soil and as we study the strata, we
find evidence of a gradual retreat of the briny waters
without proofs of any very violent or sudden disruptions
of the ocean. The creation or appearance of
sea animals, fishes, polyps, and the formation of limestone,
sandstone, slate, grit, and pebble, are parts of
the story here recorded.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>The retreat of the briny waters continued and continued
for ages, until finally the Cumberland or Wasioto
Mountains emerged, followed by the Black, Laurel,
Pine, Long, and Galico Mountains; other lower elevations
then rose until only an inland sea, surrounded
by sandy hills, remained. Then the grasses, reeds,
and mosses left their impress; land animals, insects,
birds, and reptiles appeared; vegetation increased,
and trees and shrubs grew.</p>

<p>Still the waters receded; marshes, muddy swamps,
licks, small lakes, ponds, clay and marl deposits were
left; sinks and caves were formed; and land plants
and animals increased.</p>

<p>As the waters still slowly but surely receded, creeks,
rivers, and valleys received their present shape, the
ocean reached its actual level, and the American continent
assumed its shape. The huge animals&mdash;the big
bears, buffaloes, jaguars, elephants, and mastodons&mdash;roamed
over what is now Kentucky, and left their
impress at Big Bone Lick, Drennon's Lick, and other
points where the savage, the settler, and the man of
science have successively meditated and marveled over

<p>When but a little girl one of my greatest delights
was to sit at the feet of my maternal grandfather
and listen to the tales of the olden times. Grandfathers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
and grandmothers always love to tell stories,
and boys and girls love to hear them. Our grandparents
were not the only ones that enjoyed telling
stories of the great past; Indians also related many
things to their children of what had happened in the
long ago. But as the red men had no books in which
to record these happenings, some of their stories may
be of real incidents and a great deal may be purely
imaginary, for we know the Indian was always very
superstitious.</p>

<span class="caption">The Indians loved to tell stories to their children.</span>
</div>

<p>There is a story told by the Lenni-Lenape Indians,
who lived in eastern United States, that their ancestors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
in the very earliest times were mere animals living
underground. One of them accidentally found a hole
by which he came to the surface of the ground, and
soon the whole tribe followed. These Indians believed
that they gradually became human beings; so in remembrance
of their ancestors, they chose such names
as "Black Bear," "Black Hawk," "Red Horse," and
"Sitting Bull." Some of the tribes believing in this
tradition would not eat any underground animals
like the rabbit, ground hog, and ground squirrel, for
fear they would be eating their kinsmen.</p>

<p>Another very interesting tradition told by these
Lenni-Lenape, or Delawares, is that these ancestors
came from west of the Mississippi and that when
they tried to cross this stream the right of passage
was disputed by a powerful force called the Alligewi,
from whose name we get the word Allegheny. Being
determined to cross this mighty stream and move
eastward, the Lenni-Lenape joined with the Mengwe
(Iroquois) in a war upon the Alligewi, overcame them,
and almost exterminating them, drove the remnant
of their tribe entirely from the country.</p>

<p>General G.R. Clark, Colonel McKee, and Colonel
James Moore at different times and places were told
by Indians, among them the noted chiefs "Cornstalk"
and "Tobacco," that before the red men came to
Kentucky&mdash;named from Ken-tuck-ee, meaning in
Indian language, "the river of Blood"&mdash;a white
race, superior in many arts and crafts unknown to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
the red men, the builders of the many forts, and the
inhabitants of the vast burying grounds, had been
besieged by the early Indians in a great battle near
the Falls of the Ohio. The remnant was driven into
a small island below these rapids, where the entire
race was "cut to pieces."</p>

<p>In confirmation of this, there was found on Sandy
Island, a vast burying ground and "a multitude
of human bones was discovered." This traditional
testimony has been in many instances confirmed by
unmistakable traces of a terrible conflict throughout
the Ohio Valley. The story of these bloody battles,
handed down for generations, very probably caused
the Indians to name this place the "Dark and Bloody
Ground." Believing it to be filled with ghosts of its
primitive people, it is no small wonder that this race,
full of imagination and superstition, should use it so
little as a permanent home.</p>

<p>But who was this primitive race? Whence did
they come and what did they accomplish? The
works they built have lived after them, and from
these silent memorials the people have been called
Mound Builders. Beyond the bounds of memory,
into the land of mystery we go when we strive to learn
of them. They have left their imprint in the valleys
of the Licking, the Kentucky, the Ohio, and the Cumberland.
Their many mounds vary in size, shape,
structure, location, contents, and use. Some cover
only a small area, while others have a diameter of over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
one hundred feet and one covers fifteen acres. They
display a considerable knowledge of geometry, engineering,
and military skill.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 300px;">

<span class="caption">Relics of the Mound Builders.</span></div>

<p>Because some have supposed these ancient people
to have been sun worshipers, the "high places" for
ceremonial worship are called temple mounds. The
fact that these are more numerous in Kentucky than
elsewhere, may have given rise to the expressions
"sacred soil" or "God's country." Within or near
these inclosures are mounds containing altars of stone
or burned clay, known as altar mounds; the burial
places, called mounds of sepulture, are isolated and
contain human remains which shed more light on the
character and achievements of this prehistoric race
than any others. The military mounds, or works of
defense, are usually near a waterway, often on a precipitous
height, in a commanding position, and with
an extension ditch or moat; the skill, the foresight,
and the complete system shown by these would prove
that there were fierce foes to be resisted and a vast
population to be defended.</p>

<p>It is possible that all agricultural work was done
with "digging sticks." Fishing and hunting were
accomplished by arrows, knives, and spears, chipped
from stone or rubbed out of antlers, by fishhooks of
bone, and by nets. There were also "animal calls"
made from small mammal bones, and the hollow bones
of the birds. The knives were probably chipped stone
points, clamshells, or bear teeth; there were also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
awls of bones, strainers of pottery, hammerstones,
whetstones, chisels of bone, and needles from bones
of small animals. Modeling, impressing, twisting,
knitting, painting, and sculpture were carried on;
personal ornaments,


rattles, whistles, and
pipes were made.
Moccasins, beads of
pottery, bone, shell,
teeth, and copper, and
pottery of various
sizes, shapes, and
decoration were and
sometimes are still
found all along the
streams of the state.</p>



<p>We know that they
were an agricultural
class because in some
mounds were found remains of Indian corn and beans,
also hickory nuts, butternuts, walnuts, chestnuts, hazelnuts,
and pawpaw seeds.</p>

<p>While in some instances the graves were more or less
surrounded by limestone slabs, in other places the
dead were laid on skins or on the bare ground, and
covered with skins and soil heaped above. As this soil
had to be carried in baskets or skins, these immense
mounds stand as mute memorials of their love for one
another.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="SOME_PREHISTORIC_REMAINS" id="SOME_PREHISTORIC_REMAINS"></a>SOME PREHISTORIC REMAINS</h2>


<p>There are many curious natural formations in
Kentucky; yet the many artificial mounds also have
added interest to the topography, and it is sometimes
difficult to distinguish where nature ends and
art begins.</p>

<p>The noted scientist, C.S. Rafinesque, claimed to
have discovered one hundred and forty-eight ancient
sites and over five hundred monuments in this state.</p>

<p>The greater number of the mounds were small cone-like
structures from five to ten or sometimes forty
feet in height; in several counties those of pyramid
shape were found, and other counties contained unusual
structures.</p>

<p>In Bourbon were found several sites, forty-six monuments,
a circus of fourteen hundred and fifty feet,
and a town whose stretch of walls measured four
thousand six hundred and seventy-five feet.</p>

<p>Hickman County had a teocalli, or temple, ten feet
high, thirty feet wide, and four hundred and fifty feet
long.</p>

<p>Livingston with several sites and monuments had
also an octagon whose walls measured twenty-eight
hundred and fifty-two feet in length.</p>

<p>In McCracken was found a teocalli fourteen feet
high and twelve hundred feet long.</p>

<p>Rockcastle had a stone grave three feet high, five
feet wide, and two hundred feet long.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>Warren claimed a ditched town, octagonal in shape,
measuring in perimeter one thousand three hundred
and eighty-five feet.</p>

<p>In Trigg was found a walled town with a circumference
of seven thousand five hundred feet.</p>

<p>A mound more than twenty feet high with a diameter
of over one hundred feet was located in Montgomery.</p>

<p>In Estill was located one fifteen feet high, one hundred
and ninety-two feet in diameter, and surrounded
by a moat ten feet deep and thirty-five feet wide.</p>

<p>A horseshoe-shaped fort of about ten acres in area
was found in Caldwell. Its curve was bordered by a
perpendicular bluff of sixty feet, and the two points
of the shoe were connected by a stone wall ten feet
high and six hundred feet long, with a gateway eight
feet wide.</p>

<p>In Hickman, O'Bryan's fort; in Madison, a stone
fort containing four or five hundred acres; and in
Greenup, an effigy mound representing a bear, "leaning
forward, measuring fifty-three feet from the top of
the back to the end of the fore leg and one hundred
five and one half feet from the tip of the nose to the
rear of the hind foot," with those already mentioned,
give a faint idea of the variety of mounds in shape,
size, and structure. Yet these are only a few of the
many ancient remains in Kentucky of the Mound
Builders who have left their imprint throughout our
great central valley and whose wide range has left
in the same mound "the mica of the Alleghenies, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
obsidian of Mexico, the copper of the Great Lakes,
and shells from the Gulf of the Southland."</p>

<p>Since the location of these remains the plowshare
has leveled many mounds, but several can yet be
traced.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_DISCOVERY_OF_KENTUCKY" id="THE_DISCOVERY_OF_KENTUCKY"></a>THE DISCOVERY OF KENTUCKY</h2>


<p>Do you ever feel, when reading of the deeds of the
early European navigators, who braved the perils
of the trackless deep only to find on this shore a tangled
"forest primeval," that our own beloved Kentucky
is in every way far removed historically from them?</p>

<p>Since it is so interesting and edifying to find ourselves
related to some noted personage, let us see if
we can connect the "Dark and Bloody Ground" with
the discoveries that opened up a new world.</p>

<p>We must go back many, many years, yes, even to
the Middle Ages, if we would see how and why we are
at least a small link in the great chain of events that
gradually gave to the western world one of its proudest
commonwealths. Some one has said, "Westward the
course of empire takes its way," but for centuries
the people of Europe concerned themselves not with
what lay to the west of them but with the people
and problems of the East. This is easy to understand
when we learn that the copper, lead, tin, and manufactures
of Europe were carried by traders, partly
by sea and partly by land, to Constantinople or to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
Egypt, where they were exchanged for the luxuries
that Asia had sent by vessels or camels. India and
the Spice Islands sent cloves, cinnamon, ginger, pepper,
mace, nutmeg, camphor, musk, aloes, and sandalwood,
also diamonds and pearls. Cathay (China) sent silks,
while Cipango, the island of mystery, in the great
ocean east of Cathay that no one had seen, was
believed to be the richest of all.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 660px;">
<img src="images/ill-0023.jpg" width="660" height="412" alt="" title="A caravan crossing the desert." />
<br /><span class="caption">A caravan crossing the desert.</span></div>

<p>In 1453, while this exchange was at its height, the
Turks conquered Constantinople, seized the caravan
routes, and ruined the trade. Gold and pearls, ivory
and diamonds, spices and silks, could no longer be secured
unless a waterway could be found to the East.</p>

<p>Prince Henry the Navigator, a Portuguese, though
many of his captains thought that in the torrid zone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
the ocean was boiling and that flames filled the air,
succeeded in reaching almost to the equator before
his death in 1460. In 1487, Diaz continued the work
to the Cape of Good Hope. Christopher Columbus,
believing the earth a sphere, thought that by sailing
due westward only two thousand five hundred miles
he would reach China and India. So in August, 1492,
after seeking aid in vain from Portugal, England,
and his own country, he braved the "Sea of Darkness"
in a Spanish ship. Though some Portuguese sailors
had said, "You might as well expect to find land in
the sky as in that waste of waters," in October of the
same year he made the discovery that gave to the
world a new continent.</p>

<p>Then the spirit of adventure and aggrandizement
dominated the Spanish race. Ponce de León, Fernando
Cortez, Pizarro, and Fernando de Soto continued
the work until June, 1543. Luis de Moscoso,
the successor of de Soto, with a remnant of his once
proud force, now reduced to about three hundred men,
in boats descended the Mississippi River to its mouth;
from the boats they were the first white men to behold
the land that is now Kentucky.</p>

<p>England, so far, had been very quiet and conservative
about discovering, exploring, or settling.
Finally, English fishermen came to Newfoundland.
Sir John Hawkins traded negroes for hides and pearls,
and Sir Francis Drake ravaged the Caribbean coast
and in 1577-1580 sailed around the world. Soon Sir<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
Humphrey Gilbert attempted colonization, which was
taken up by his half brother, Sir Walter Raleigh, who
sent two ships under Philip Amadas and Arthur Barlowe,
who discovered the coast of North Carolina.
Upon their return, Queen Elizabeth named it Virginia.
Kentucky was included in the charter of
this first colony, which was settled at Jamestown,
1607.</p>

<p>The first Englishman to view what is now Kentucky
was Colonel Wood, who in 1654, for commerce and not
conquest, explored the northern boundary of Kentucky
as far as the Mississippi River, then called the Meschacebe.
Captain Bolt (or Batt) of Virginia in 1670
came from that state into what is now Kentucky. In
1673 Jacques Marquette, a Jesuit missionary, in
company with Luis Joliet and five other Frenchmen
in two canoes passed down the Mississippi along the
western border of Kentucky and spent several days at
the mouth of the Ohio, where Cairo, then called Ouabouskigou,
now stands. Again in February, 1682,
Robert de la Salle and his lieutenant, Henri de Tonti,
in company with several other Frenchmen, descended
the Illinois River, and passed down the Mississippi, or
Colbert, to its mouth, claiming the country on both
sides for the French king, Louis the Great, in whose
honor they called this vast tract Louisiana.</p>

<p>It was as a prisoner among the Indians in 1730 that
the first white native American, John Sailing of
Virginia, was taken to Kentucky. In 1750 a party of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
Virginians, among them Dr. Thomas Walker, came by
way of Powell's Valley through a gap in Laurel
Mountain, into central Kentucky. He named both
the mountain and the river (formerly the Shawnee)
for England's "Bloody Duke" of Cumberland who
defeated the Scottish forces at Culloden. Some say
that near where they entered what is now the state of
Kentucky these men built a rude cabin.</p>

<p>But it was left for John Finley and party, 1767, to
learn and love this wonderland of fertile soil, towering
forests, luxuriant vegetation, and boundless supply
of game. When he returned to North Carolina with
such glowing accounts of this wilderness beyond the
mountains, many were ready to leave the comforts of
civilization for the dangers and privations of this land
of promise.</p>



<p><br /><br /><br /></p>
<h2><a name="INDIAN_CLAIMS_IN_KENTUCKY" id="INDIAN_CLAIMS_IN_KENTUCKY"></a>INDIAN CLAIMS IN KENTUCKY</h2>


<p>Though the Indians at the time of the coming of
the white men used Kentucky mainly as a hunting
ground instead of a home, various tribes laid claim to
it by prior possession.</p>

<p>In 1768, at Fort Stanwix&mdash;now Rome, New York&mdash;the
English government purchased the title to all
the lands lying between the Ohio and Tennessee
rivers from the tribes of Indians called the Six Nations.
This tract included the present state of Kentucky.</p>

<p>Shortly after the battle of Point Pleasant, 1774, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
Shawnees entered into a treaty with Governor Dunmore
of Virginia whereby they gave up all title to the
lands south of the Ohio River.</p>

<p>At the Sycamore Shoals, of the Watauga River,
1775, Colonel Richard Henderson, acting for the
Transylvania Company, purchased the title of the
Cherokees to this "hunting ground" for ten thousand
pounds sterling. This purchase was afterwards declared
null and void by the states of Virginia and
North Carolina.</p>

<p>Through the commissioners Isaac Shelby and
Andrew Jackson, the general government in 1818
purchased from the Chickasaws, for an annuity of
twenty thousand dollars to be paid for fifteen years, all
their land lying in Tennessee and Kentucky between
the Mississippi and Tennessee rivers. The part in
Kentucky has since been called "Jackson's Purchase."</p>

<p>Thus we see that Indian claims to Kentucky were
relinquished only upon payment of money or blood.</p>



<p><br /><br /><br /></p>
<h2><a name="SCOUWA" id="SCOUWA"></a>SCOUWA</h2>


<p>There lived in Pennsylvania in the early part of
the eighteenth century a young man by the name of
James Smith. A short while before General Braddock
was defeated by the French and Indians, Smith
was taken prisoner by a band of Indians, and carried
to the French fort where the city of Pittsburgh now
stands. Here he was made to run the gantlet; and so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
well did the Indians, ranged on either side, use their
clubs and sticks and stones, that Smith was badly
beaten and made ill for a long time.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 660px;">
<img src="images/ill-0028.jpg" width="660" height="462" alt="" title="Scouwa was adorned by the Indians." />
<br /><span class="caption">Scouwa was adorned by the Indians.</span>
</div>

<p>The Indians then carried him to their home in Ohio,
where an old chief pulled out the prisoner's hairs one
by one; only a scalp lock was left which was ornamented
with feathers and silver brooches. His ears
and nose were pierced and hung with silver rings, his
face, head, and body were painted, and he was adorned
with a breechcloth, chains of beads, a belt of wampum,
and silver armlets.</p>

<p>An old chief then made a speech to the other Indians,
while he held Smith by the hand. The prisoner was
then accompanied to the river by three young squaws<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
who attempted to "duck" him. Fearful of being
drowned, Smith resisted until one of the women in
broken English cried, "No hurt you, no hurt you."</p>

<p>After "scrubbing all the white blood out of him,"
they dressed him in a ruffled shirt, leggins, and moccasins,
presented him with a pipe, tobacco, pouch,
flint, steel, and tomahawk and told him he had been
adopted in place of a brave young chief who had
fallen.</p>

<p>The Indians called Smith "Scouwa." They finally
gave him a gun to use and trusted him fully, but because
he once lost his way in the woods, his gun was
taken from him and for a long while he was permitted
to use only a bow and arrow.</p>

<p>Smith had some exciting experiences while living the
life of an Indian. At one time, during a snowstorm,
he took refuge all night in a hollow tree, and when he
tried to move the block by which he had closed up
the opening in the side of the tree, he found the snow
was piled so deep against it he could not move it.
He was badly frightened, but by pushing with all his
strength he finally succeeded in getting out.</p>

<p>At another time Smith, an old chief, and a little
boy were alone in their hut in midwinter and all came
near starving, but Smith walked many, many miles,
hunting game, and thus saved the lives of all three.</p>

<p>In 1759 the Indians that had adopted Smith journeyed
to Canada; and as Canada then belonged to the
French, and as the French and Indians were fighting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
the English, who then owned Pennsylvania, Smith
slipped away. Joining the prisoners that were to be
sent back to Pennsylvania in exchange for some French
the English held, he soon rejoined his family. He
was a leader of the "Black Boys," served as lieutenant
in General Henry Bouquet's expedition, and witnessed
the Indian cruelties to the unfortunate British captives.</p>

<p>In July, 1766, he learned that the king's agent,
Sir William Johnson, had purchased from the Indians
all the land west of the Appalachian Mountains, and
between the Ohio and Cherokee (Tennessee) rivers.
Having heard the red men tell of this rich land, Colonel
James Smith, accompanied by Joshua Horton, Uriah
Stone, William Baker, and a mulatto slave of Horton's
named Jamie, passed through Cumberland Gap, explored
the country south of the Kentucky River, and,
striking the Cumberland, passed down its entire length
to its junction with the Ohio. They were the first
white men to explore southern and southwestern
Kentucky, although not the first to visit it, for in
1730 John Salling of Virginia was brought a prisoner
by the Cherokee Indians to the Tennessee. After
reaching the mouth of the Cumberland, the others
separated from Colonel Smith and the mulatto boy.
These two were for a long time alone in the wilderness.
When they again reached civilization they wore nothing
that had been woven; and when they told of their
experiences, people could hardly believe that any one
could make that journey and live to return.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>A short distance below the mouth of the Cumberland
the town of "Old Smithland" was named in honor
of this first white man to explore that region, and later
the town was built just at the junction of the Cumberland
and Ohio and is now the capital of Livingston
County.</p>

<p>Smith spent the latter part of his life in Bourbon
County, where he was as useful in state councils as
he had been in Indian conflicts.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_GRAVEYARD_OF_THE_MAMMOTHS" id="THE_GRAVEYARD_OF_THE_MAMMOTHS"></a>THE GRAVEYARD OF THE MAMMOTHS</h2>


<p>There are many places within the present bounds
of Kentucky where animals used to go to lick the
ground, in order to secure the salt therein, and these
places were therefore called "licks." The most noted
of these is in Boone County, and is called Big Bone
Lick from the many gigantic bones that have been
found there.</p>

<p>In 1773, while leading a surveying party, a man
by the name of James Douglas, of Virginia, camped
for several days at this point. There he found a surface
of ten acres entirely without trees or vegetable
life of any kind, while scattered around were many
bones both of the mastodon and the arctic elephant.
The size of these gigantic, prehistoric animals may be
conjectured from the descriptions given of the remains.</p>

<p>Tusks were found from seven to eleven feet long,
the latter being at the larger end six or seven inches<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
in diameter. Thigh bones, five feet in length; teeth
weighing ten pounds with crowns seven by five inches;
skulls, thought to be of young animals, measuring
two feet between the eyes; ribs from three to four
inches broad and so long that James Douglas and his
party used them for tent poles, are some of the wonders
that have given the name to this historic place.
Scientists have decided from these remains that these
ponderous animals belonged to the elephant family.
Though possessing remarkable strength, they were
so unwieldy that prehistoric man encountered little
danger in combating them. It is the supposition
that the early inhabitants who occupied this continent
when these marvelous animals roamed the woods,
must have planned to exterminate them on their
periodic visits to the lick. By what means this was
accomplished we can only conjecture, but that there
was a wholesale slaughter is evident, for at no other
place have so many mammoth remains been found.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_DRUID_OF_KENTUCKY" id="THE_DRUID_OF_KENTUCKY"></a>THE DRUID OF KENTUCKY</h2>


<p>Daniel Boone was born in the almost unbroken
forests of Pennsylvania, on February 11, 1735. Without
his energy, caution, and daring, Kentucky would
not have been settled so soon. In both his native
state and in North Carolina, he received in his boyhood
the training that was to fit him for the great
work that was to be his.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>Truly "coming events cast their shadows before,"
for when barely large enough to shoulder the old
family flintlock he found unbounded delight in roaming
the woods and returning laden with his spoils,
which at one time was the skin of an immense panther
that he shot just as it was about to spring upon him.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 660px;">

<br /><span class="caption">&quot;They found Boone in camp.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>While yet in his early teens he gave his family great
alarm by being absent for two days and nights. A
rescuing party was sent out, and they soon saw smoke
rising in the distance; proceeding, they found Boone
in camp, his floor carpeted with the skins of animals
he had slain, while the delicious odor of roasted meat
filled the air.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>Boone was in every way a typical backwoodsman.
His education was limited to an imperfect
knowledge of the "three R's," gained in the rude
school cabin of round logs, puncheon seats, and dirt
floor. Ever the solitude of the sylvan forests was
far more enjoyable to him than the refinements of
civilization.</p>

<p>In 1755 he was married to Rebecca Bryan, who
with him shared much of the danger and hardships
of frontier life.</p>

<p>In 1769, yielding to the siren song sung by John
Finley of the far-famed cane land with its fertile soil,
towering mountains, limpid streams, and rich meadowlands
where the spoils of the chase were venison, bear,
and buffalo, Boone left his family and friends on the
Yadkin in North Carolina and came with Finley and
four others to explore this marvelous land of "Kentuckee."</p>

<p>Reaching the Red River, five miles from its junction
with the Kentucky, these pioneers pitched their
camp and from June until December reveled in the
delights of hunting and exploring in this Eden of the
wilderness; but one day, near Christmas, Boone and
a companion named Stewart, while out hunting,
were captured by the Indians and for six days and
nights were marched and guarded. At length, believing
their captives were contented, the savages
relaxed their watchfulness, yielded to sleep, and Boone
and Stewart escaped. Upon their return to camp<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
they found it plundered and their companions gone.
What became of them Boone never knew.</p>

<p>Soon after, Boone and Stewart were surprised by
meeting Squire Boone, a brother of Daniel, and another
man from North Carolina. A few days later Stewart
was shot and scalped; the man who came with Squire
Boone tired of the perils and returned home. The
two brothers were left alone in the vast wilderness,
hundreds of miles from any settlement and with no
weapon but the trusty rifle and tomahawk to protect
them from the cunning savage, the ravenous wolf,
and the crafty panther. When their ammunition
began to run low, Squire Boone retraced his steps to
Carolina for a fresh supply, while Daniel remained
alone until July, when his brother returned. Together
they roamed at will, tracing the streams, hunting
game, and enjoying this romantic woodland.</p>

<p>Having been absent from his family for three years,
simply for the joys of the frontier, and having lived
upon the meat of wild animals, the fruits and roots
of the forest without either bread or salt, Boone returned
in 1771 to the Yadkin and so thrilled all with
his glowing description of this land of promise that,
when two years later he started with his family to
this forest, five other families and forty men accompanied
them. The women riding, the children driving
the cattle and hogs, with bedding and baggage
strapped on pack horses, the men with trusty rifles
forming both advance and rear guards, this little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>cavalcade started forth to conquer the wilderness.
All went well for a while, but, when near the Cumberland
Mountains, they were attacked by Indians, and
six men were killed, among them Boone's oldest son.
Yielding to the others, Boone returned with the party
to the Clinch River in southwestern Virginia, where
they remained until 1774.</p>

<span class="caption">&quot;Boone&#39;s little cavalcade started forth to conquer the wilderness.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>For twenty years Boone was a notable figure in
this untried forest, prudent, calm, honest, courageous,
cunning; a stranger to fear, a devotee to duty, an
honored leader, he has so left his impress upon our
state that the record of this period of his life is Kentucky
history.</p>

<h2><a name="A_PIONEER_NOBLEMAN" id="A_PIONEER_NOBLEMAN"></a>A PIONEER NOBLEMAN</h2>


<p>During the eighteenth century, many men, singly
or in companies, enjoyed the beauties of the forest
scenes of Kentucky. Always they carried back to
the centers of civilization the most glowing accounts
of hill and dale and stream, of the abundance of game
and fish, of the fertility of the soil, and of the glorious
monarchs of the forest. These hardy woodsmen
had the inherent love of Nature in her wildest, most
gorgeous aspects. They were pioneers, hunters, and
trappers. To some these terms convey only the
thought of rough, unsophisticated men with none of
the benevolent qualities of head or heart, with no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
magnanimity of spirit for a friend and nothing but
the most intense hatred for a foe. But the lives of
some of these frontiersmen furnish incidents from
which we might well take lesson.</p>

<p>One of these, James Harrod, though unable to write
his name, has so indelibly impressed it upon the annals
of the early times that as long as history is read he
will be famous. In May, 1774, Captain Harrod with
about thirty men descended the Monongahela and
the Ohio in canoes to the mouth of the Kentucky
River. Penetrating the forest, they built the first
log cabin ever erected in Kentucky, at the place where
Harrodsburg now stands. Here a town was laid off
and called Harrodstown. After four or five cabins
had been built depredations of the Indians caused
them to be deserted until the following spring, when
Harrod with many of his former comrades and several
others returned. This place was subsequently called
Oldtown and later Harrodsburg, fittingly commemorating
the grand pioneer who built not only the first
cabin but the first town in our commonwealth.</p>

<p>James Harrod was by nature endowed with all the
qualities of a great leader; he is described as tall
and commanding, energetic and fearless, honest and
generous, ignorant yet intelligent. Inured to difficulties
and dangers, familiar with the forest, skillful with
his rifle, he was a success as a hunter, but a terror to
his foes. He was a real leader of the pioneers. In the
words of Marshall, "He always had a party, not because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
he wanted a party, but because the party wanted him."
Unremitting in the care of his companions, unrelenting
in his attacks on the "red rascals," untiring in services
to his neighbors and friends, he was truly a
nobleman, with a lofty yet gentle spirit. "If news
came of an Indian massacre, he snatched his gun
and ran at the head of the party; if he knew of a
family left destitute, he shouldered his rifle and ranged
the forest till he found the game to supply their needs;
if he heard of a horse being lost he stopped not till
he drove him to his owner's gate." Thus he was
known by his contemporaries. Yet he seemed not
to be ambitious. Only as a delegate from Harrodstown
and as a colonel of the militia is he found in
civil affairs. But the magnanimity of his spirit shone
forth at all times.</p>

<p>There is one incident related of him that proves
him as chivalrous as any knight of old. He was at
one time so closely pursued by some Indians that
he plunged into a swollen stream and, holding his
rifle above the water with one hand and swimming
with the other, reached the farther shore in safety.
Two of the redskins, bolder than the others, followed.
When the foremost was about midstream a shot from
Harrod's rifle caused him to disappear with a cry of
pain beneath the rushing torrent; the other gave
up the chase.</p>

<p>Several hours afterward, when Harrod had reached
a point a few miles below where he had crossed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 592px;">
<img src="images/ill-0040.jpg" width="592" height="660" alt="&quot;With arms extended, Harrod stepped in view.&quot;" title="" />
<span class="caption">&quot;With arms extended, Harrod stepped in view.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>stream, he was astonished to see a warrior slowly
and painfully draw himself upon a pile of driftwood
and attempt to apply a rude bandage to his
shoulder down which the blood was flowing. Harrod
at once knew that this was the same Indian who
had hotly pursued him and that the wound was from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
his own rifle shot. Most men at such a time would
have relentlessly shot their adversary. Such a thought
never entered the mind of James Harrod. He at once
resolved to assist his disabled foe. Cautiously he
stole to one of the trees on the bank a few yards from
where the Indian sat, and, laying aside rifle, tomahawk,
and knife, he stepped suddenly in view, with
arms extended to show he was unarmed and meant
no harm. The startled Indian was about to plunge
again into the water, when a second glance assured
him no immediate harm was meant, for not only was
the white man unarmed but his kindly countenance
convinced the Indian no wrong was intended. Yet
so strange was such a proceeding to the savage, that
while he permitted his former enemy to approach, yet
he watched him as would a wounded wild animal,
ready at any moment to seek refuge in the rushing
waters.</p>

<p>Harrod, finding the Indian weak from loss of blood,
gently assisted him to the shore, tore off a bandage
from his own clothing, dressed the wound, and taking
him upon his back, carried him several miles to a
cave, where he nursed him until he was able to rejoin
his tribe.</p>

<h2><a name="EARLY_KENTUCKY_CUSTOMS" id="EARLY_KENTUCKY_CUSTOMS"></a>EARLY KENTUCKY CUSTOMS</h2>


<p>When the bands of hardy pioneers pushed into the
wilderness and prepared a way into Kentucky they
brought with them only the trusty rifle, the ax, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
tomahawk, and the "long knife" for protecting themselves
from the wily savages and securing food from
the game that roamed the woods.</p>

<br /><span class="caption">Making brooms.</span>
</div>

<p>When their families came, a few more articles were
brought along; but their outfits were necessarily
meager. When they stopped to prepare their food,
a flat stone was used for cooking the "journey cake,"
while bark served for dishes.</p>

<p>As soon as the destination was reached, a log cabin
of rough unhewn timbers was built, containing a long
pen of split logs placed in a row, which, filled with
fresh boughs, was a welcome resting place for those
who were wearied from traveling. Later the feathers
of wild pigeons, ducks, and geese were made into
feather beds.</p>

<p>Usually several people settled at the same place
and built a fort of cabins, stockades, and blockhouses,
arranged in a hollow square. The blockhouses were
two stories high, the upper story projecting over the
lower one for eighteen or more inches. The places
of entrance to the fort were closed by large folding
gates of thick slabs, and the entire outer wall made
bullet proof, all without a single nail or piece of iron.
Some of the cabins had puncheon floors while others
had only the bare earth.</p>

<p>There were very few metal utensils; tin cups, iron
forks, and spoons were very rare. Nearly all their
tools were fashioned of wood, by their own hands.</p>


<p>There were no mills, but each family had a hominy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
block or wooden bowl with pestle, in which the Indian
corn was pounded, or a rough homemade grater on
which it was grated.
Their brooms were made
of hickory saplings split
at one end into fine
splinters for several
inches; these were
bound together at the
top with a green withe,
while the other end of
the pole served as a
handle.</p>



<p>Their lye was all
made at home by pouring
water several times
through a hopper of
ashes until it became a
reddish-brown; bear's
grease was added to this
and the mixture boiled until it became a soft mass
called soap. We of to-day would dislike very much
to use it in bathing.</p>

<p>Their salt was precious, for eight hundred gallons
of salt water boiled down made only one bushel; if
that amount was bought, it cost twenty dollars.</p>

<p>In the spring they bored holes in the maple trees,
from which flowed a sap or sweet water that when
boiled down made maple sirup and maple sugar.</p>

<p>In those days of danger the men built the cabins,
garrisoned the forts, hunted the game, felled the
trees, mauled the rails, grubbed the roots and bushes,
and tilled the soil.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>The women did the household duties, brought the
water, gathered the wild nettles, and from the silky<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
fibers in the leaves spun and wove the flax from which
they made their clothing. They tanned the deerskins
by means of hardwood ashes and from them
made moccasins and shoepacks, for there was no
place to buy shoes; they made for the men the historical
hunting shirt of deerskin, linsey-woolsey, or
coarse, home-woven linen. This garment served various
purposes; the bosom was so designed as to form
a wallet in which to carry bread, jerk, parched corn,
or tow for cleaning guns. This shirt was held together
by a belt which was tied behind; in the front
of this belt they carried their bullet bags and mittens,
while on one side hung the scalping knife in its leather
sheath, and on the other, the tomahawk. Breeches,
leggins, and moccasins of deerskin and hats or caps
of fur, often adorned with the animal's tail, completed
the costume of the men. The women wore
dresses of linsey-woolsey and coarse flax.</p>

<p>So the rude pioneer home, with its lack of conveniences
and space and its few rude, imperfect tools,
was the factory where were prepared not only the
clothing and food, but also the furniture and the
medicine.</p>

<h2><a name="BOONES_ILLUSTRIOUS_PEER" id="BOONES_ILLUSTRIOUS_PEER"></a>BOONE'S ILLUSTRIOUS PEER</h2>


<p>Among the hardy backwoodsmen, fearless hunters,
and brave fighters, there looms no nobler figure than
that of Simon Kenton, born of humble, Scotch-Irish
parents in Virginia, April 13, 1755. At sixteen he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
was a stalwart youth with scarcely any education,
with a kind heart but unrestrained emotions. Having
fallen very much in love with a beautiful girl of his
neighborhood, and having lost her to a successful
rival, he went as an uninvited guest to the wedding
festivities, where he made himself so disagreeable that
the infuriated groom and his brothers gave him a
severe beating.</p>

<p>Shortly after this, meeting his former rival, William
Veach, Kenton provoked a fight and was so much the
physical superior that soon his adversary fell bruised,
bleeding, and unconscious; kind-hearted Kenton, feeling
that he had been cruel in his treatment, lifted
up the head of his insensible victim, spoke to him,
but receiving no reply, thought him dead. Much
alarmed, he left the seemingly lifeless body and fled
to the woods. Feeling himself a murderer and a
fugitive from justice, he warily made his way to Cheat
River, where he changed his name to Simon Butler,
and worked long enough to secure a gun and ammunition.</p>

<p>In order to lose himself and forget his trouble
in the western wilderness, he joined a party to Fort
Pitt, where he hunted for the garrison and forts, and
met Simon Girty, who afterwards saved his life. Two
others, George Yeager and John Strader, came with
him that autumn on his first visit to Kentucky, lured
on by the glowing accounts of the "cane land" that
Yeager had heard of from the Indians. They came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
down the Ohio to the mouth of the Kentucky, but
soon returned to the Big Kanawha, where they camped,
hunted, and trapped until March, 1773. Yeager
was killed by the Indians, and Kenton and Strader
fled to the woods barefooted and almost naked, with
no food and no weapons. For six days they wandered
weary, footsore, and hungry, until finally in
despair they lay down to die. Gathering hope anew,
they pressed on and near the Ohio met some hunters
who gladly gave them food and clothing.</p>

<p>Going with them, Kenton worked for another rifle
and in the summer of the same year went down the
Ohio with a party in search of Captain Bullitt. They
failed to find him and the party returned through the
wilds of Kentucky to Virginia with Kenton as guide.</p>

<p>During the winter of 1773-1774, Kenton hunted on
the Big Sandy, but volunteered and soon saw active
service as a scout and spy in the armies of Lord Dunmore
and General Lewis in the Miami Indian War.
He received an honorable discharge in the autumn,
and the next spring, yielding to the longing for the
"cane land," he came down the Ohio and one night
reached Cabin Creek a few miles above Maysville.
The next day, when he beheld the far-famed land, he
was entranced, and soon encamped near the present
site of Washington, in Mason County, where he and
his companion cleared an acre of ground and planted
it with corn which they had bought from a French
trader.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>They found this place a veritable "hunter's paradise"
where the hills were covered with herds of deer,
elk, and buffalo.</p>

<p>One day meeting two men, Hendricks and Fitzpatrick,
who were without food or guns, Kenton invited
them to join his station. Hendricks accepted,
but his companion, desiring to return to Virginia,
was accompanied by Kenton and Williams to the
Ohio. They left Hendricks alone at the camp. On
returning they found the camp in disorder and Hendricks
gone; the next day his charred remains told
the story of his sufferings at the hands of the savages.</p>

<p>Though Kenton left this place the following autumn,
he returned nine years later and, building a blockhouse
here, established Kenton's Station.</p>

<p>Simon Kenton was ever alert, ever ready to respond
to the call for help, ever ready to encounter danger,
and ever ready to give his services to the settlers
whether at Harrodstown or Hinkson's, whether in aid
of Boone or Clark.</p>

<p>At one time Kenton was one of six spies who, two
at a time, each week ranged up and down the Ohio
and around the deserted stations, watching for Indian
signs; for the red savage had become infuriated because
the "long knife"<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> had taken possession of his
beloved "Kaintuckee," and the Indian invasions
were frequent and bloody.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 660px;">

<span class="caption">&quot;Boone was borne on Kenton&#39;s shoulders into the fort.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>One morning as Kenton with two companions was
standing in the gate at Boonesborough ready for a
hunt, the Indians fired on some men in the field, who
fled to the fort. One man, however, was overtaken,
tomahawked, and scalped within seventy yards of
the gate. Kenton shot the savage dead and in the
battle which ensued killed two other Indians, one
of whom was about to tomahawk Colonel Boone,
who had been crippled. The unerring rifle of Kenton
stayed his savage hand, and Boone was borne on
Kenton's shoulders into the fort. When the gate was
barred and all was secure, the usually reserved Boone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
said, "Well, Simon, you have behaved yourself like
a man to-day; indeed you are a fine fellow."</p>

<p>Kenton accompanied General George Rogers Clark
in his expedition against Kaskaskia in 1778, then
proceeded to Vincennes, where, by a three days' secret
observation, he secured an accurate description of
the place which he sent to General Clark.</p>

<p>Kenton returned to Harrodstown, aided Boone in
defending the stations, and in September, 1778, was
taken a prisoner, a few miles below Maysville, by the
Indians, who beat him until their arms were too tired
to indulge in this amusing pastime any longer. They
then placed him upon the ground on his back, drew
his feet apart, lashed each to a strong sapling, laid a
pole across his breast, tied his hands to each end, and
lashed his arms to it with thongs which were tied
around his body; then they tied another thong around
his neck and fastened it to a stake driven in the ground.
Thus he was forced to pass the night. The next morning
he was painted black and carried toward Chillicothe,
where they said they would burn him at the
stake.</p>

<p>As a diversion they one day tied him securely on
an unbroken horse, which they turned loose to run
through the woods at will. Through undergrowth,
among trees and patches of briers, the horse capered,
pranced, plunged, and ran, trying in vain to discharge
his load until finally he stopped from sheer exhaustion.
Kenton was destitute of clothing, bruised, bleeding,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
and almost lifeless. Arriving at the village, they tied
their distinguished prisoner to the stake, where he was
left for twenty-four hours, expecting every moment
that the torch would be applied. After enduring this
agony he was forced to run the gantlet, where six
hundred Indians were ranged on either side with
switches, clubs, and sticks, and each gave him a blow
as he passed. Kenton had been told if he reached
the council house he would be set free. When he had
almost reached the door of deliverance he was knocked
insensible. Again he was made a prisoner, was taken
from town to town, eight times was compelled to run
the gantlet, three times tied to the stake, and once
almost killed by a powerful blow with an ax.</p>

<span class="caption">Simon Kenton</span>
</div>

<p>Once Simon Girty, the notorious renegade, remembering
their former friendship, saved him from the
flames; again Logan, the Mingo chief, interposed,
stayed the fury of the savages, and persuaded a
Canadian trader named Drury to buy him from his
captors. Drury took him to Detroit, and delivered him
to the British commander, where he received humane
treatment until 1779. Then a Mrs. Harvey, the
wife of an Indian trader, while a crowd of Indians
were drunk, took three of their guns and hid them
in a patch of peas in her garden. At midnight Kenton,
following her directions, secured them, and with
two other Kentucky prisoners hastened to a hollow
tree some distance from the town, where ammunition,
food, and clothing had been placed by the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
benefactress. The three fugitives after thirty-three
days of incredible suffering reached Louisville.</p>

<p>Later, with General George Rogers Clark in command,
Kenton, the great scout and spy, piloted the
Kentuckians, when in 1780 they carried the war into
the Indian's own country.</p>

<p>During all these dangers there had ever been the
horrible feeling that he was a fugitive and a murderer;
but meeting by chance some one from his boyhood
home, Simon Kenton learned that his former rival,
William Veach, was still alive.
He resumed his rightful name,
hastened home, made friends
with Veach, and started with
his father and family again
to this great paradise of the
West.</p>



<p>Kenton, so great in all the
qualifications of the pioneer,
was not schooled in the arts
of civilization. His ignorance,
coupled with his great confidence
in men, which amounted
almost to credulity, caused him to lose most of his
valuable lands; but at last the legislature of Kentucky
made some reparation to the old, heroic soldier
whose deeds and daring will ever furnish ennobling
themes for song and story.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>



<p><br /><br /><br /></p>
<h2><a name="BOONES_TRACE" id="BOONES_TRACE"></a>BOONE'S TRACE</h2>


<p>Though Kentucky was not the home, but merely
the hunting grounds, of most of the Indians, yet there
were varied and conflicting claims.</p>

<p>While the Six Nations sold their title to this vast
area to the British, and the Shawnees at last relinquished
their rights, still the Cherokees pressed their
claim until Henderson's company, composed of nine
men of education and ability from North Carolina,
purchased from them, in 1775, at the Watauga River,
about seventeen million acres of land for ten thousand
pounds ($50,000). This company hoped to found a
colony and sell land to immigrants. They named
this region Transylvania&mdash;"beyond the woods."</p>

<p>Later, this purchase was declared by both Virginia
and North Carolina to be null and void, and the plan
was abandoned. Before this, however, Daniel Boone
had been sent to open up a trace or road from the
Holston River to the mouth of Otter Creek on the
Kentucky River, where later Boonesborough was built
and the first legislature in Kentucky was held.</p>

<p>This road was to be for the travel of men and pack
horses, the pioneer's train. Hastening forward with
his brother, Squire Boone, Colonel Richard Calloway,
and several others&mdash;thirty in all&mdash;Daniel Boone
began to "blaze the way" in the wilderness for the
countless thousands who were to come after them.</p>

<p>Beginning at Watauga, the trace led to the Cumberland Gap,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
where it joined the "Warrior's Path,"
which it followed for about fifty miles northward;
from this place it followed a buffalo trace to the
northwest until it reached the Kentucky River.</p>

<p>Blazing the trees with their hatchets, cutting their
way through dead brush, removing undergrowth,
chopping through cane and reed, the party proceeded
on their perilous journey. Within about fifteen miles
of their destination, while asleep in camp, they were
attacked by the Indians. Later they were again
fired upon by the savages, when two of the white men
were killed and three wounded. Here, five miles
south of Richmond, from necessity was erected the first
fort in Kentucky. This stockade fort was called Fort
Twetty, as here Captain Twetty died and was buried.</p>

<p>Pushing on, Boone and his companions reached the
site selected, and soon constructed a stockade fort of
two cabins, connected by palisades. This formed the
nucleus of the fort, which was completed in about
two months and which was named Boonesborough.</p>

<p>The trace or road opened by Boone has had various
names; it has been called "Boone's Trace" or "Boone's
Trail," "the Virginia Road," "the Road to Caintuck,"
"the Kentucky Road," and "the Wilderness Road."
This last name was given from the great wilderness of
laurel thickets between the Cumberland Gap and the
settlements in Kentucky, a length of two hundred
miles without a single habitation.</p>

<p>Along this difficult highway a narrow and often zigzag<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
path in the forest, six hundred miles in length, came the
countless men, women, and children from Virginia who
were to found this great commonwealth of Kentucky,
a worthy daughter of a most worthy mother.</p>

<p>When the legislature of Kentucky in 1795 passed

<h2><a name="BOONE_IN_CAPTIVITY" id="BOONE_IN_CAPTIVITY"></a>BOONE IN CAPTIVITY</h2>


<p>On New Year's Day, 1778, Daniel Boone with
thirty companions left Boonesborough for the Blue
Licks, to make a year's supply of salt for the garrisons.</p>

<p>A few weeks later, while hunting several miles from
the camp, he was overtaken by a party of one hundred
Indians and attempted to escape. The fleet warriors,
needing a white captive to give them information
about Boonesborough, instead of shooting Boone as
he ran, gave chase and captured the hardy backwoodsman.</p>

<p>Now all the cunning of Boone was sorely needed.
He wished to prevent if possible the capture of the
salt makers and to postpone the march of the savages
on the garrison. How the wily old hunter managed
we do not know. But he finally secured the promise
of the Indians that if the party at Blue Licks would
surrender, they would be well treated as prisoners
and their lives spared. Arriving at Blue Licks, Boone
made signs to the white men to surrender without
resistance; this they did, and the promise made by the
Indians to Boone was sacredly kept.</p>

<p>Three of the white men managed to escape; when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
the Indians had gone, they returned, hid the kettles,
and carried home the salt, as well as the news of the
captivity of Boone and his companions.</p>

<p>The prisoners were marched through severe weather
to the principal Shawnee town, old Chillicothe, on
the Little Miami River in Ohio. In March, Boone
and ten others were carried to Detroit, where the
British commander, Governor Hamilton, offered the
Indians £100 sterling for Boone, intending to send
him home on parole. But Boone had so won the
hearts of his dusky captors that they would not
patiently listen to any plan that would take him
from among them. The great hunter had to feign
contentment and not wound the feelings or excite
the suspicion of his captors.</p>

<p>Leaving the other prisoners at Detroit, the savages
returned to their capital with Boone, whom they soon
adopted into one of the principal families. Although
they plucked out his hairs, one by one, except the
scalp lock of about three inches on the crown; although
he was taken into the river and given a scrubbing,
"to take out all his white blood"; although he was
harangued by the chief about the great honor shown him;
and although he was frightfully painted and bedecked
in feathers,&mdash;through it all he appeared content and
thus still more endeared himself to the Indians.</p>

<p>After this the Indians would challenge him to shooting
matches, in which he was cautious not to excel
them too often, for fear of arousing their envy or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
jealousy, but would beat them often enough to excite
their admiration.</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 421px;">
<img src="images/ill-0058.jpg" width="421" height="660" alt="&quot;Boone was frightfully painted and bedecked in feathers.&quot;" title="" />
<span class="caption">&quot;Boone was frightfully painted and bedecked in feathers.&quot;</span>
</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>



<p>Boone was very careful to show respect and loyalty
to the leading chief, to favor him often with the spoils
of the hunt, and thus lead all to believe that he was
happy to have cast his lot among them.</p>

<p>This apparent contentment was only another evidence
of what a silent stoic Boone could be, for his
every thought was with his family and friends; but
to serve them as well as to save himself, he must
pretend pleasure in his lot.</p>

<p>Returning one day in June from where a party of
the Indians had carried him to make salt for them,
the old hunter found a party, of nearly five hundred
warriors ready to march on his beloved Boonesborough.
Now Boone felt that his captivity served a good purpose,
for he determined at all hazards to escape and
warn the garrison.</p>

<p>The Indians had so relaxed their vigilance over
him that he was able to effect this resolve. Rising
at the usual hour on June 16, he went out ostensibly
to hunt, but so great was his anxiety that he made
no attempt to kill anything to eat, but hastened on
over the perilous trip of one hundred and sixty miles
and reached home in four days. During this time
he ate only one meal, the food he had hidden in his
blanket. He was joyfully received like one risen
from the dead, though his family, thinking him killed,
had returned to North Carolina.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>The fort was in a defenseless condition, but the
return of their old leader, the news he brought, and
the confidence he inspired, soon put all in readiness
to receive the enemy.</p>



<p><br /><br /><br /></p>
<h2><a name="BOONESBOROUGHS_BRAVE_DEFENSE" id="BOONESBOROUGHS_BRAVE_DEFENSE"></a>BOONESBOROUGH'S BRAVE DEFENSE</h2>


<p>Finding their captive gone, the Indians delayed
their march on Boonesborough, until, impatient to
fight the foe, Colonel Boone with nineteen others,
among whom was Simon Kenton, started in August
to attack the Indians at Paintcreektown, in Ohio.
When within about four miles of the place, Kenton,
who was in advance, was surprised and startled by
hearing loud laughter from a canebrake just before
him. He had scarcely secreted himself when two
Indians, seated on a pony, one facing the animal's
head, the other his tail, dashed by his place of concealment.
Kenton fired, both savages fell, one killed,
the other severely wounded. As Kenton was taking
the latter's scalp he was suddenly surrounded by about
thirty Indians, who were at once dispersed by the
arrival of Boone and his party.</p>

<p>Boone, dispatching spies, at once learned that the
Indian town was deserted; so he lost no time in retracing
his steps to Boonesborough, which he reached
one day in advance of the Indian army, led by Captain
Duquesne, a Canadian Frenchman. The invading
army, four hundred strong, appeared flying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
the British colors. The savage warriors, painted in
hideous colors, paraded in two lines, giving the most
bloodcurdling yells and brandishing their guns. It
was enough to try the stoutest heart.</p>

<p>Soon a large negro stepped in front of the line and
in English called for "Captain Boone," but there
was no reply. Again he said he wanted to speak
to Captain Boone, and if he would come out, he would
not be hurt.</p>

<p>The men in the fort objected to their leader's going,
but Boone, armed with a pipe and a flag, went out
alone, leaving instructions that if he was made prisoner
his men should shut the fort and defend it to the last.</p>

<p>In about one hour he returned, telling his companions
that the Indians had promised that if he would
surrender the fort he and his companions would not
be hurt. To pacify the Indians he had seemed to
assent to this plan, promising to return the next day,
and inform them of the result of his conference with
his companions.</p>

<p>When the little band of less than fifty fighting men
met in council and learned that they could make a
manly defense with small chance of success, and if defeated
they would become victims of savage barbarity,
or they could surrender at once, become prisoners, and
be stripped of their effects, the deliberation was short,
the answer prompt, and voiced by each:</p>

<p>"We are determined to defend our fort as long as a
man of us lives."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>The next day Boone again met the assaulters and
asked for another day in which to secure the assent
of the remainder in the fort, to surrender.</p>

<p>The time thus gained was improved by making every
preparation possible; they collected the cattle and
horses, fastened the gate with bars, and in every way
made ready for the conflict.</p>

<p>The next morning, from one of the bastions of the
fort, Colonel Boone made known to the commander
of his adversaries the determination of the garrison,
at the same time thanking them for the time in which
to prepare his defense.</p>

<p>Disappointment was plainly evident in the countenance
of Duquesne; he did not at once give up
hope of a capitulation, but decided if possible to
entrap Boone. He declared that in his order from
Governor Hamilton he was told simply to take the
white people as prisoners of war, neither to rob nor
destroy them. If nine of the principal men would
come out and treat with them, there would be no
violence; they would only return with the prisoners
or, if they would swear allegiance and accept the
protection of the British king, they would be set
free.</p>

<p>Boone felt this was one more chance to save his men
from slaughter. The conference was called about sixty
yards from the gate of the fort; the articles were read,
agreed upon, and signed. Then the commander said
that among the Indians it was customary on such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
occasions to show their sincerity by two Indians shaking
each white man by the hand. Boone agreed to this.
At once two Indians approached each of the nine white
men and as they took his hand attempted to seize and
make him prisoner. The white men with great strength
sprang away, and fled to the fort amid a shower of
bullets from Indians in ambush, who came rushing
up with the most terrifying yells. All reached the fort
in safety with the exception of one wounded man.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 660px;">
<img src="images/ill-0063.jpg" width="660" height="628" alt="&quot;The fight now began in earnest.&quot;" title="" />
<span class="caption">&quot;The fight now began in earnest.&quot;</span>
</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>The fight now began in earnest, and lasted nine
days. The enemy tried various ways to overcome
the garrison. At one time they secreted a part of
their force under the bank of the Kentucky, attacked
the fort on the opposite side, and finally pretended
to retreat; this ruse failing, they began to undermine
the houses by excavating under the river bank and
digging toward the fort. This was discovered by
the muddy water caused by the great quantity of
the loose earth they were compelled to throw into the
river. Boone at once began to dig a trench within
the fort, and as the loose dirt was taken up it was
thrown over the fort wall. Finding their plan was
discovered, the Indians abandoned it, but that night
attempted to fire the fort by pitching torches of cane
and hickory bark upon it. A rain had fallen a few
hours before and the wet logs did not burn easily,
and the flames were soon extinguished by the whites.
Next day finding that they could not conquer by
"force or fraud" and that their stock of provisions
was almost exhausted, they paraded and withdrew
after thirty-seven had been killed in sight of the fort
and many others wounded. In the fort there were
only four wounded.</p>

<p>After the savages had gone the white men picked
up one hundred and twenty-five pounds of leaden
bullets which had fallen near the fort walls, besides
the vast number that had lodged in the walls and
palisades.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="THE_LOST_BABY" id="THE_LOST_BABY"></a>THE LOST BABY</h2>


<p>If your baby brother or sister should be lost, even
though our country is thickly peopled and we have a
perfect network of telephones and telegraphs across
it, think how alarmed you would feel! Yet think
how much more anxious a mother would be if her
baby were lost in a wilderness where wolves, wildcats,
and panthers roamed hungry and fierce.</p>

<p>This really happened to a baby boy named Bennie
Craig. His father, Benjamin Craig, who presented
his commission as a magistrate at the first county
court held in Gallatin County, 1799, left Virginia
in 1781 with his wife and three children. In those
early days people traveled on foot or horseback, carrying
with them what household necessities they could
by means of pack horses.</p>

<p>The men and larger boys generally walked ahead,
to be sure no Indians lurked in ambush; the smaller
boys and girls drove the cows and sheep, and watched
to keep them from wandering off through the woods;
while the women rode horseback, having tied on the
backs of the horses all the absolutely necessary household
utensils.</p>

<p>In this party the usual plan of travel prevailed.
Mrs. Craig and baby Bennie were on one horse,
followed by another loaded with meal, bacon, salt,
and skillets and tools; another one of these pack
horses had, strapped across its back, some hickory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
withes holding on each side a basket made of the
boughs of the same tree. These baskets carried what
bedding and clothing were needed for the new homes.
In one of these baskets was placed also a little boy
of six, in the other a little girl of four. Sometimes
the mother permitted baby Bennie to ride in the
basket with his little sister. All three children found
many things of interest as they rode along in this
strange, new land.</p>

<p>One morning Mrs. Craig laid baby Bennie, who
was asleep, on a bed of leaves amid the boughs of a
fallen tree, while she helped pack the things to start.
As Mr. Craig was anxious to overtake some travelers
who were ahead of him, because in numbers there
was greater safety, he hurried Mrs. Craig on her
horse; when she called for the baby, the little sister
begged that it be allowed to ride again with her. The
mother consented, rode on, and the father began to
load the other horse; he safely tucked the little boy
and girl away in the baskets, but in the excitement
of overtaking the other travelers both father and
children forgot baby Bennie.</p>

<p>About an hour later Mrs. Craig, looking back, saw
only two children and cried out, "Where is the
baby?" All were frantic with fear when they realized
that the baby had been left behind.</p>

<p>Mr. Craig hastily stripped the pack from one of
the horses, sprang up on its back with gun in hand,
and with all possible speed hurried back. For nearly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
two hours the rest waited and watched, wept and
prayed. Finally the sound of the horse's hoofs was
heard and Mr. Craig came at full gallop, shouting,
"Here he is, safe and sound! The little rascal hadn't
waked up."</p>

<h2><a name="THE_FIRST_ROMANCE_IN_KENTUCKY" id="THE_FIRST_ROMANCE_IN_KENTUCKY"></a>THE FIRST ROMANCE IN KENTUCKY</h2>


<p>Difficulties, suffering, and danger beset the early
pioneers. Yet none of these prevented love, love-making,
and marriage. The earliest romance was
that of Samuel Henderson and Betsey Calloway, at
Boonesborough, in 1776. There came near being no
wedding, for late in the afternoon of Sunday, July 14,
when the midsummer sun caused each one to hunt a
cooler place, Elizabeth and Frances Calloway and
Jemima Boone, the oldest daughter of Daniel Boone,
started out for a boat ride on the river. They were
drifting along in their canoe, unconsciously near the
opposite shore, when they were suddenly surprised
and terrified at the appearance of five Indians who
waded into the water and dragged their canoe ashore.</p>

<p>The three girls screamed with fright, but Betsey
Calloway showed herself a true pioneer by gashing
the head of one of her assailants with her paddle.
Before dragging them from the boat the Indians forced
Frances Calloway and Jemima Boone to put on Indian
moccasins, but Elizabeth, or Betsey, again showed
her courage by refusing to do so. We can well imagine
the horror when the people at the fort realized that
the girls were in the hands of the savages. Both
Boone and Calloway were absent, but soon returned
and lost no time in starting for rescue and revenge.
Two parties set out: one on foot with Colonel Boone
and the three lovers of the three girls, Samuel Henderson,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
John Holder, and Flanders Calloway, respectively;
another on horseback.</p>

<p>As soon as they reached the north side of the river,
Boone drew them up in line, placing the middle man
at the trail, and pressed forward in pursuit. His
daring was equaled only by his discretion, for should
the pursuers be seen by the Indians, it was highly
probable the three maidens would suffer death by the
tomahawk. Betsey Calloway came near suffering
thus when the savages discovered her breaking off
twigs by which she could be trailed. Though the
upraised tomahawk with a threat to use it caused her
to desist from this, she slyly tore off bits of her linsey-woolsey
dress, and occasionally pressed the heel of
her shoepack into the soft earth, thus leaving a trail.</p>

<p>By these signs, in the reading of which Colonel Boone
was almost as wary as the Indians, the rescuing party
hardly lost sight of the direction taken, although the
captors compelled the girls to walk apart through the
thick cane and wade up and down the streams of
water, in an effort to hide their trail. On Tuesday
morning, when about forty miles from Boonesborough,
the whites came upon the captors just as they had
kindled a fire to cook some buffalo meat. The two
parties saw each other about the same time, but as
their weapons were piled at the foot of a tree, and
the whites fired at once and rushed upon them, the
Indians hastily fled without knife, tomahawk, or
even moccasins. The three girls were unharmed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 507px;">

<span class="caption">&quot;The whites fired and rushed upon them.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>Betsey Calloway, a brunette much tanned by exposure,
was mistaken by one of the rescuing party for an
Indian, as she sat with the two wearied maidens<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
asleep with their heads in her lap. Just as he was
about to dash out her brains with the butt of his gun
his arm was arrested by one who recognized her, and
a most horrible tragedy was averted. Amid rejoicing
they returned to the fort.</p>

<p>On the seventh of the next month Squire Boone,
a Baptist minister, performed the first marriage ceremony
in Kentucky, when Betsey Calloway became
the wife of Samuel Henderson. The other two couples
soon followed their example.</p>



<p><br /><br /><br /></p>
<h2><a name="A_WEDDING_IN_THE_WILDERNESS" id="A_WEDDING_IN_THE_WILDERNESS"></a>A WEDDING IN THE WILDERNESS</h2>


<p>The boys and girls in the early days of Kentucky
usually married very young; and a wedding was
an event so important that every one in the entire
community felt a personal interest in the affair.
The ceremony was usually performed just before
noon.</p>

<p>On the morning of the appointed day the groom and
his attendants met at the home of his father and
proceeded to the home of the bride. The gentlemen
wore only clothes that were homemade; linsey shirts,
leather breeches and leggins, moccasins or shoepacks,
and caps of mink or raccoon skin with the tail hanging
down the back completed their costume.</p>

<p>The ladies were beautiful in linsey-woolsey, coarse
shoes, or moccasins embroidered with beads and quills,
and buckskin gloves. Just after the ceremony there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
was a feast of venison and bear, beef and pork,
turkeys and geese, potatoes and cabbage, cornmeal
mush with milk and maple sugar, ash cake and
dodgers.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 660px;">
<img src="images/ill-0072.jpg" width="660" height="455" alt="&quot;As soon as dinner was over, the dancing began.&quot;" title="" />
<span class="caption">&quot;As soon as dinner was over, the dancing began.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>As soon as dinner was over the dancing began and
lasted not only through the afternoon but through
the night until dawn. The square dance, the reel,
and the jig were the figures that gave most joy to their
flying feet.</p>

<p>Either the next day, or very soon thereafter,
the neighbors helped the newly married couple
"settle." A party of choppers felled and trimmed
the trees, others hauled them to the site, while others
made the clapboards for the roof, and puncheons for
floor and door. If any windows were made, they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
covered with oiled doeskin and had thick shutters.
No one had windows filled with glass in those
days.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>The neighbors helped not only to raise and cover the
house, but to make the furniture also. A table was
made from a slab of wood with four legs driven into
auger holes; some three-legged stools were made of
like material. Sticks driven into auger holes in the
wall supported clapboard shelves where various articles
were kept. A few pegs were likewise driven in the wall
where the wearing apparel of both men and women
was hung. A pair of buck horns or two small forks
fastened to the logs held the ever trusty rifle and
shot pouch.</p>

<p>Nor did they stop here. Through a fork placed
with its lower end in a hole in the floor and its upper
end fastened to a joist, they placed poles with their
ends through cracks in the walls. Over these, clapboards
were laid. When the whole had been covered
with skins of bear and deer, this made a most comfortable
bed.</p>

<p>At these house raisings, log rollings, and harvest
homes there was much merriment coupled with the
hard labor. Any man who failed to perform his part
of the work was dubbed "Lazy Lawrence" and was
denied similar help when he needed it.</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>
<h2><a name="PIONEER_CHILDREN" id="PIONEER_CHILDREN"></a>PIONEER CHILDREN</h2>


<p>The boys and girls of to-day with all the comforts
and luxuries surrounding them often pity the pioneer
children and wonder how they spent their time. However,
they doubtless were as happy and ambitious as
we are. The boys early learned to chop, to grub
bushes up by the roots, maul rails, trap turkeys,
tree coons, and shoot a rifle. When severe weather
kept them in the fort, there were not only the duties
of making brooms and brushes but also the wrestling,
leaping, and shooting matches where each strove to
excel the other. How proud was the youth when he
could "bark a squirrel," that is, shoot off the bark so
near the squirrel that the force killed it, without inflicting
a wound.</p>

<p>The girls also had their work and play. They watched
the cattle to keep them from straying too far away,
they hunted flat rocks on which to bake "journey
cakes," they helped to pound hominy, bring water,
gather wild nettles, and assisted in soap making,
sugaring, sewing, candle molding, and wool carding.
There were likewise near-by excursions for hickory
nuts, walnuts, hazelnuts, grapes, pawpaws, honey
locusts, hackberries, huckleberries, blackberries, dewberries,
and raspberries.</p>

<p>But you say, "All this sounds like fun. Boy Scouts
and Camp-Fire Girls do many of these things and
count them sport. The boys and girls of the early<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
days in Kentucky must have had one long holiday
with no thought of school or school work." There
you are mistaken, for scarcely had the first women
and children come to Harrodstown when Mrs. William
Coomes taught in the fort, in 1776, the first school in
Kentucky. In 1777, John May taught at McAfee's
Station, and two years later Joseph Doniphan was
teaching at Boonesborough.</p>

<p>So these boys and girls of those far-away days,
although they had no well-warmed, well-lighted,
well-ventilated schoolhouses; although their teachers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
were not always so scholarly and cultured as one could
wish; although often in the earliest days they had
no attractive textbooks, and their only means of
learning to read, write, and calculate was from copies
set by their teachers; although instead of paper they
used smooth boards on which to write, with the juice
of the oak balls for ink; although when they could
read there were no absorbing storybooks,&mdash;yet they
made progress and perhaps studied as hard as some
children of to-day.</p>

dimes, nickels, and pennies, often find it difficult to
"make change." Still more difficult was it for the
early settlers to do so.</p>

<p>As the Indians used wampum and the early settlers
of Virginia, tobacco, so the pioneers of Kentucky
used the skins of wild animals as their first currency.
While immigrants continued to come to this region,
Spanish silver dollars came gradually into circulation.
Still there was no small change.</p>

<p>As "Necessity is the mother of invention," our
forefathers actually made change by cutting the
dollar into four equal parts, each worth twenty-five
cents. These were again divided, each part worth
twelve and one half cents, called bits. People sometimes
became careless in the work of making change<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
and often cut the dollar into five "quarters" or into
ten "eighths." On account of the wedge shape of
these pieces of cut money, they were called "sharp
shins."</p>

<p>If change was needed for a smaller sum than twelve
and one half cents, merchants gave pins, needles,
writing paper, and such things.</p>

<p>This cut silver gradually found its way back to the
mint for recoinage, usually to the loss of the last owner.
As late as 1806, a business house in Philadelphia received
over one hundred pounds of cut silver, brought
on by a Kentucky merchant, which was sent on a
dray to the United States Mint for recoinage.</p>

<h2><a name="A_WOMANS_WILL" id="A_WOMANS_WILL"></a>A WOMAN'S WILL</h2>


<p>"Where there is a will, there is a way" is an oft-quoted
proverb, and the first white woman of whom
we have any record of entering Kentucky proved it
true. In 1756 Mrs. Mary Draper Inglis, her two
small sons, and a sister-in-law, Mrs. Draper, were
taken from their homes in Virginia by the Shawnee
Indians and carried some distance down the Kanawha,
where they halted a few days to make salt, thence
to the Indian village at the mouth of the Scioto, which
is the site now of Portsmouth, Ohio. Mrs. Inglis
won her way into the favor of the savages by making
shirts of material that French traders had brought
from Detroit. She was soon held in such high esteem<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
by her captors that she was not subjected to the peril
of running the gantlet, though a greater grief was
put upon her,&mdash;that of being separated from her two
sons at the division of the prisoners.</p>

<p>After spending a few weeks at the mouth of the
Scioto, a number of the savages proceeded to Big
Bone Lick, over a hundred miles away. With them
they took Mrs. Inglis and an old Dutch lady who had
been in captivity for a long while. Not being daunted
by fear or distance from home, these pioneer women
planned and effected an escape. On the pretext of
gathering grapes they started from camp one afternoon
with only a blanket, knife, and tomahawk.</p>

<p>With eager feet they reached the Ohio, and followed
its windings, until after five days' journeying they found
themselves opposite the mouth of the Scioto. Fortune
favored them, for a horse was grazing there and
also some corn was close at hand. Although near
Indian villages, they loaded the horse with corn and
pressed on to the mouth of the Big Sandy, but were
compelled to go farther up that stream to effect a
crossing. After going some distance, the women
crossed on driftwood, but the horse, falling among the
logs, was finally abandoned, and with only a scanty
store of corn they pursued their dangerous journey.</p>

<p>Had it not been for walnuts, grapes, and pawpaws,
hunger would have stayed their steps. Even
with these the Dutch woman was not long satisfied
and, driven to desperation, she threatened and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>attempted the life of Mrs. Inglis. But the latter
succeeded in escaping from her frantic companion
and, finding a canoe, took a broad splinter for a paddle
and reached the Ohio shore. When morning dawned
and the Dutch woman saw Mrs. Inglis on the other
bank, she pleaded with her to return to her rescue.
But fearing a repetition of her late fury, Mrs. Inglis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
turned a deaf ear to entreaties and hastened, as fast
as her exhausted condition permitted, towards home.
At last, after more than forty days of dire suffering
and destitution, she reached a cabin where careful
attention soon restored her to health and from there
she was taken to a near-by fort and restored to
her husband. A party went in search of the Dutch
woman and brought her safely to the settlement.
One of the little sons died soon after being separated
from his mother, while thirteen years elapsed before
the father found and rescued the other.</p>

<h2><a name="WHEN_THE_WOMEN_BROUGHT_THE_WATER" id="WHEN_THE_WOMEN_BROUGHT_THE_WATER"></a>WHEN THE WOMEN BROUGHT THE WATER</h2>


<p>The women of Kentucky have never been known to
falter whatever demand duty might make upon them;
yet at no period in the history of our commonwealth
has there been any more severe test of the
courage of her daughters than occurred on the morning
of August 15, 1782, at a point about five miles northeast
of Lexington on the present road from that city
to Maysville.</p>

<p>This post had been settled in 1779 by four brothers
from North Carolina, named Bryan, hence the name
"Bryan's Station." About forty cabins had been
"placed in parallel lines and connected by strong
palisades." This fort and the station at Lexington
had been selected as special places on which to visit
the wrath and retaliation for massacre of some Indians<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
upon the Sandusky; and as the savages and their
renegade allies had been successful, they were easily
incited to a general attack and inspired with the idea
of regaining their hunting grounds and driving the
paleface across the Alleghenies.</p>

<p>Simon Girty, the notorious renegade, was at the
height of his glory when, in response to requests of
runners sent to various tribes, there began at Chillicothe,
August 1, 1782, a gathering of Cherokees,
Shawnees, Miamis, Wyandots, and Potawatamis.</p>

<p>Ere the march began, the party numbered nearly
six hundred warriors. With great secrecy and rapidity
they descended the Little Miami, crossed the Ohio,
and reached central Kentucky. In the hope of drawing
away the fighting forces from the stations warned,
Girty sent a party of Wyandots, who harassed
Hoy's Station, and captured two boys. Captain
Holder, gathering what men he could, pushed forward
in pursuit, but was defeated August 12, at Upper
Blue Licks. When runners spread the news to the
various forts, the call to rally to Holder's assistance
was as quickly responded to as if it had been imperative.</p>

<p>Girty knew of the common custom of rallying
to the needs of neighboring settlements, so he expected
to find a defenseless fort at Bryan's Station
when he and his band of savages reached there on the
night of the 14th. Instead, all within seemed awake
and alert; lights were shining and fires burning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
brightly. Girty at once suspected that his coming
had been heralded. The truth was that it was the
preparation for the morrow's march that caused such
activity; not one suspected that such a horde of
murderous savages was so near. So when at the
early dawn the men started from their fort, they were
much surprised at a heavy fire from ambuscade, but
they were so near the gates that they soon retreated
within and prepared for a stormy siege. Couriers
carried the news of the attack to Lexington, Todd's,
St. Asaph's, and Boonesborough. While awaiting
reinforcements from these stations, the sixty backwoodsmen
prepared to protect themselves and their
families.</p>

<p>Knowing the siege would be severe and perhaps long,
they began to consider seriously the question of securing
water; for, by an oversight, the men who built
the fort placed it at some distance from the spring
which supplied their wants. As cunning as the Indians,
and equally as strategic, were the men opposed
to them. Instinctively they felt that the savages
were ambushed near the spring expecting the men to
come for a supply of water, when it would be the
work of only a very few moments to fire upon them,
and through the gateway gain admittance to the fort.</p>

<p>After talking over the matter the men within the
fort called together all the women, disclosed their
suspicions concerning the location of a part of the
enemy, but told them they felt no violence would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
offered women and urged them to go in a body to
bring water. The women hesitated and said that
they were not bullet-proof and that savages scalped
alike the male and the female. In reply the men said
that the women usually carried the water, and that if
the men should go, the Indians would know that their
ambuscade had been discovered and would at once
rush upon the whites and gain admittance to the
fort; but if the women went as usual, the savages
would think their hiding secure and would longer
delay the attack. The women knew that water they
must have, if the garrison withstood the inevitable
siege; they also knew that the views of the men were
correct and that the request for them to bring the
water arose from no desire on the part of their husbands
and brothers, sons and fathers, to shirk duty
or shift danger.</p>

<p>So when the Spartan-like mothers agreed to the
plan, the younger women followed their example,
and everyone, matron and maid, with pail in hand or
piggin on head, marched down to the spring, while
they "feared each bush" an Indian. Though vainly
striving to appear calm, when returning</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i3">"The way seemed long before them,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And their hearts outran their footsteps";<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>so the nearer the gate they came, the quicker was their
walk until it finally ended in a very brisk run and
very few entered the fort with full vessels. Tradition
says that as the last entered so hastily and spilled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
the water so freely the Indians broke into a laugh.
But the women had "been tried and not found wanting";
they had proved themselves to be true helpmates
of those sturdy men who were striving to gain
a home in the western wilds.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 486px;">
<img src="images/ill-0086.jpg" width="486" height="660" alt="&quot;The walk finally ended in a very brisk run.&quot;" title="" />
<span class="caption">&quot;The walk finally ended in a very brisk run.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>Erelong the arrangements for defense were completed
and thirteen men marched out to form a
decoy party on the Lexington road; their orders
were to fire rapidly, make all possible noise, but not
to pursue the savages too far. They obeyed orders
well and as soon as the guns sounded in the distance,
five hundred warriors, led by Girty, rushed from the
ambush near the spring, expecting to force their way
over defenseless walls. The greater part of the
sixty men had resolved themselves into a reception
committee, expecting just such a call. So, when "their
deadly balls whistled free," wild cries of terror came
from Girty's ranks and "in two minutes not an Indian
was to be seen," while the thirteen reëntered through
the opposite gateway, very jubilant over the success
of their little ruse.</p>

<p>The attack was renewed, but nothing of marked
importance occurred unless it was the supreme coöperation
that went on within the fort. Every breech was
repaired, every gate and loophole manned; men,
women, and even children were busily engaged in
firing at the foe, molding bullets, or quenching the
flames that the burning arrows from the bows of the
savages had lighted. At two in the afternoon, just at a
time when the firing had ceased, about fifty men, from
various stations, one third on horse, the rest afoot,
came in reply to the request sent out that morning.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>As the Indians knew that runners had been dispatched
for reënforcements, they had planned to
receive them. On one side of the road "stood the
forest primeval," while on the other side was a vast
field of one hundred acres of luxuriant corn, ten feet
high, whose long green banners formed a dense thicket.
Here on each side lay warriors within range of the road
over which they knew the men would come. As
soon as the horsemen appeared, shots from the guns
of the savages rang out; but quickly spurring their
horses, the recruiting party escaped within the fort
through such a cloud of dust that not one was wounded.</p>

<p>Had the foot soldiers been more cautious, they
too might have fared better; but hearing the firing
on their friends, they rushed forward into the presence
of the great crowd of savages, who, having emptied
their guns, began to advance with tomahawk; but
in many instances they were held at bay by the muzzle
of the frontiersman's gun. Thus for an hour, the
savages pursued the flying soldiers, who when too hard
pressed turned and aimed, but did not fire until absolutely
forced to do so, as they could have no time
to reload.</p>

<p>In a skirmish, a ball from a rifle brought Girty to
the ground, but when the warriors gathered around
him, they found that it was only the force that had
caused him to fall, as the ball had struck a thick piece
of leather in his shot pouch. Despairing of success,
Girty crawled to the protection of a huge stump,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
hailed the fort, and attempted negotiations. He
spoke in commendatory terms of their courage, but
assured them that to pursue such policy further was
madness, as in addition to his six hundred warriors
he would soon have reënforcements with cannons,
when their weak walls would no longer protect them.
He urged an immediate surrender, pledged his honor
to protect them as prisoners of war, and inquired if
they knew him, Simon Girty.</p>

<p>Some were rather anxious at the news of artillery,
but a young man named Aaron Reynolds inspired the
weaker ones with courage when he derisively told
the speaker to bring on his reënforcements; that they
too were expecting reënforcements and if Girty and
his savage allies remained much longer, their scalps
would grace his cabin. He said Girty was "very
well known," that he himself owned a cur, so worthless
that he called him "Simon Girty."</p>

<p>Offended at such language, Girty rejoined his chiefs.
The night passed without interruption, but daylight
showed camp fires burning, meat roasting, and not an
Indian in sight. They had evidently departed just
before dawn.</p>



<p><br /><br /><br /></p>
<h2><a name="THE_RESULT_OF_ONE_RASH_ACT" id="THE_RESULT_OF_ONE_RASH_ACT"></a>THE RESULT OF ONE RASH ACT</h2>


<p>After the retreat of the savages from Bryan's
Station it did not take long for the Kentucky riflemen
to gather and go in pursuit. In the afternoon of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
same day the savages had retreated from the fort, one
hundred and eighty-two men from the various stations
assembled. Fearing that the Indians would escape
across the river, they started at once to overtake
them, without waiting for the arrival of Colonel Logan,
who was coming with three hundred more men.</p>

<p>Colonel John Todd was put in command, while
many commissioned officers took their places in the
ranks. On they pressed, until on the second day,
as they reached the Lower Blue Licks, they saw the
Indians leisurely ascending the farther bank.</p>

<p>The pioneers halted and held a conference in which
all officers took part. The veteran Boone was asked
for his opinion which all valued. He counseled either
waiting for Colonel Logan's reënforcements or so
dividing their numbers that part could cross above
and fall in the rear of the enemy, while others could
fight from the front.</p>

<p>Some preferred the first plan, others wished to
adopt the second. In the midst of the consultation
the rash, undisciplined nature of Colonel Hugh
McGary, daring but with no deference to authority,
oblivious to peril but not prudent, caused him to
exchange some hot words with Todd and Boone;
then giving a war whoop, he rushed madly into the
stream, holding his hat above his head, and shouting,
"All who are not cowards follow me."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 660px;">

<span class="caption">&quot;Giving a war whoop, he rushed madly into the stream.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>The effect was electric. Horse and foot rushed headlong,
each trying to be foremost. No order was given,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
none observed. In their unreasonable enthusiasm
they heeded no command. In vain the officers tried
to check them, then finally followed. Reaching the
farther bank, by great difficulty a halt was secured
and spies sent ahead to examine a ravine where Boone
feared an ambush; as they returned and reported
no sign of the enemy, the pioneers moved forward
in three divisions. By the time they came to this
ravine Girty's Indians had so placed themselves that
from their murderous fire many fell. Still the pioneers
maintained their ground, until at last all hope lay in
retreat. On the bank of the river there was soon a
seething mass of horsemen, foot soldiers, and Indians.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
Sixty of Kentucky's bravest fell, and sorrow filled every
home.</p>

<p>Colonel Logan and his soldiers came next day and
buried their dead, among whom were many of the
leaders in both public and private life as well as a
son of the aged Boone.</p>

<p>There is a tradition that when the Indians saw four
more of their own among the slain than of the whites,
they barbarously put to death four of the seven pioneers
they had taken and subjected the others many times
to the most cruel and inhuman treatment.</p>

<p>Through this rash act of McGary nearly one tenth
of all the fighting men in Kentucky fell. Distress and
discouragement were general; and the greatest disaster
that had yet befallen the country had been brought
about.</p>



<p><br /><br /><br /></p>
<h2><a name="TWO_KENTUCKY_HEROES" id="TWO_KENTUCKY_HEROES"></a>TWO KENTUCKY HEROES</h2>


<p>In the latter part of the year 1779, David Rogers
was making his way from New Orleans to Pittsburgh
with two boats full of military stores. On nearing
the four-mile bar above the present site of Cincinnati,
he discovered a great number of Indians emerging
from the mouth of the Little Miami. Hastily
landing, his men cautiously crept through the underbrush,
expecting to take the Indians unawares, when
they were suddenly surprised by a large force of
savages, who with rifle and tomahawk made such a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
terrible onslaught that more than half of the whites
met an almost instantaneous death.</p>

<p>The crew, in a panic, rushed forward to their boats
only to find one in the possession of the enemy and the
other too far from shore to reach its friendly shelter.
With a courage born of despair they rushed through
the enemy's lines, and some escaped in the darkness to
Harrodstown, while others were so severely wounded
that they barely existed until they were rescued by
their friends.</p>

<p>Among these was Robert Benham, who, after
being shot through the hips, managed to crawl
to a large fallen tree and hide among its foliage.
There he quietly lay until the battle was ended,
and the Indians had returned and gathered the
spoils from the dead whites. Thinking the coast
clear once more and suffering pangs of hunger, Benham
could not resist shooting a raccoon that came
within his range, trusting to providence to reach it
after it fell. Scarcely had the sound of his gun died
away when he heard some one speak. He instantly
reloaded and sat quietly, expecting an Indian every
moment.</p>

<p>Finally some one said, "Whoever you are, answer
me."</p>

<p>He then, realizing that it was no savage, readily
answered; and soon one of his former comrades, John
Watson, appeared with both arms broken.</p>

<p>Never was there a happier combination. From that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
time the arms of Benham and the legs of Watson
each did duty for both. Benham could easily load
his gun and kill the game, while Watson could readily
kick it within reach of his companion, who could dress
and cook it. Thus they subsisted until the game in
their vicinity grew scarce; then the man with the
sound legs would walk around a drove of wild turkeys
until he got them within range of Benham's gun, who
was such a splendid marksman that he never failed
to kill two or three of the number.</p>

<p>Their greatest difficulty was in securing water; but
as in all things, "where there is a will there is a
way," so even this difficulty was obviated. Benham
would place his hat rim between the teeth of Watson,
who would wade into the river up to his chin, duck
his head, and thus fill the hat with water which he
securely delivered to the man without legs, who could
use it as needed. Benham was thus enabled to cook,
dress his own and his comrade's wounds, and feed the
latter also.</p>

<p>For several weeks they lived thus, until they grew
stronger and traveled to the Licking River. After a
great deal of difficulty in making themselves known
to some passing boats, they were rescued, and taken
to the Falls of the Ohio, where both recovered. Benham
afterwards participated in several expeditions,
and, after peace, returned to the scenes of his sufferings,
bought land there, and passed his remaining days
peacefully where he had so nearly met death.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="THE_BATTLE_OF_THE_BOARDS" id="THE_BATTLE_OF_THE_BOARDS"></a>THE BATTLE OF THE BOARDS</h2>


<p>From time immemorial women have been accused
of possessing an unusual amount of curiosity, but an
incident of the early days, in what is now Mercer
County, will prove that some men also belong to the
curious class.</p>

<p>In 1783, the same year that saw the treaty of peace
between Great Britain and the thirteen colonies go
into effect, Kentucky, still a part of Virginia, was a
dense forest, infested by roving bands of Indians
who plundered and murdered the pioneers; hence
caution was still the watchword of the white inhabitants.
During this year, three men in the early
dawn left Harrod's Station to hunt for some horses
that had strayed off while grazing. For some time,
over many miles, through dense cane and tangled
pea vine, they pursued the trail, until, as a refuge
from the darkness and a cold, drenching rain, the
pioneers took shelter in an old, deserted log cabin,
in the midst of a canebrake.</p>

<p>Having seen signs of Indians during the day and
knowing that the red men also knew of the cabin,
they decided to endure the cold, rather than light a
fire. Finally they concluded a still further precaution
would be to take refuge in the "loft" of the cabin for
fear the savage foes might also take shelter therein
and dispute the right of possession.</p>

<p>They at once climbed up into the loft, the floor of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
which was clapboards, lying loose upon some round
poles. Here, with their trusty rifles, they lay quietly
for a short time, when to their terror six armed savages
entered the cabin. Placing their guns and tomahawks
in a corner, they built a fire and began a scene of
hilarity characteristic of their tribe.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 591px;">

</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>One of the men was anxious to know the number
of the Indians. So, though he was lying on his
back, and was the middle man, he determined to
turn over and peep at the crowd below. The other
two white men determined he should keep still; so
they held him, but as he quietly struggled, a pole
broke and with a terrible crash, clapboards, men, and
guns fell upon the frightened savages, who with yells
of terror fled into the forest and never returned.
Though almost as much terrified as the Indians, the
white men quietly enjoyed the fire till morning, when
they returned to the station with their trophies of
what they laughingly called "The Battle of the
Boards."</p>

<h2><a name="THE_FAITHFUL_SLAVE_AND_HIS_REWARD" id="THE_FAITHFUL_SLAVE_AND_HIS_REWARD"></a>THE FAITHFUL SLAVE AND HIS REWARD</h2>


<p>If we search the annals of both ancient and modern
times we can find no record that shows greater fidelity
from slave to master than was exhibited by a negro
to one of Kentucky's most noted pioneers.</p>

<p>In 1782, March 19, people living in the vicinity of
Boonesborough discovered some empty rafts floating
down the river. They at once knew that Indians
had used them to cross the stream so as to attack
the unprotected settlements. News was sent to the
various stations warning the settlers. Colonel Logan
dispatched fifteen men to Estill's Station, where they
were joined by twenty-five from that fort. Under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
the command of Captain James Estill, they started
to pursue and punish the invaders.</p>

<p>Early in the morning of the 20th, Miss Jennie
Gass, with a slave, Monk, as protector, went just
outside the fort at Estill's Station to milk the cows.
Her mother, seeing the savages approaching, called
loudly for her to run, but the warning came too late.
Ere her daughter could reach the gate, her mother
saw her tomahawked and scalped.</p>

<p>Monk was captured and asked about the force of
the fort. Like the half-witted boy who was questioned
by the Tories, Monk exaggerated the situation, saying
there were forty men in the fort then molding bullets
in anticipation of an attack. The truth is that aside
from the women and children, there were only four
men, who were too disabled to march. The savages
accordingly thought it best to retreat.</p>

<p>No sooner had they withdrawn from the vicinity of
the fort than two boys were dispatched to find Captain
Estill's band and tell them of the tragedy. In a few
hours the messengers found the men, and so uneasy
were some of the party for their families that five
returned to help protect the fort, while the other thirty-five
began to search for the trail of the Indians. A
part of the horses became so jaded that ten more
dropped from the ranks, while the remaining twenty-five
pushed forward with a grim determination to
find the savages.</p>

<p>About an hour before sunset they discovered some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
Indians preparing a meal from a buffalo. When
Captain Estill fired his gun, the Indians fled, and had
it not been that their leader was wounded, the retreat
would have been permanent and the battle of Little
Mountain would never have been fought. With
almost superhuman strength the chieftain dragged
himself to a place of safety and with a defiance that
meant death he commanded his warriors who were
too loyal to retreat without their wounded leader.
There, in a space not more than two hundred yards in
diameter, was fought one of the world's fiercest battles.</p>

<p>On the one hand there were twenty-five Wyandot
warriors who defied death. On the other side there
were twenty-five pioneers, aroused to vengeance by
the cruelties the red men had visited upon them.
Well did they obey the command of Estill, "Every
man to his man, and every man to his tree." At
one time in the fiercest of the fight, the rallying tones
of confidence rang out above the crack of the rifles
as Monk, who was still held prisoner by the savages,
shouted, "Don't give way, Massa Jim, you can whip
the redskins."</p>

<p>For nearly two hours the combat lasted, neither
side advancing nor retreating. But when Captain
Estill sent Lieutenant William Miller with six men
to gain the rear of the enemy, that seven ingloriously
fled and then the savages began to gain on
the whites. Finally Captain Estill and a brawny
Indian clutched in mortal combat. For a time their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
strength seemed equal, but Estill's broken arm giving
way, the savage instantly plunged a knife into his
breast and a moment later, pierced by a bullet from
Joseph Proctor's unerring gun, fell dead across his
victim's body.</p>

<p>There the battle ended, the pioneers taking their
wounded comrades and leaving the dead upon the
field. Proctor carried one, a Mr. Irvine, a great
distance of forty miles upon his back, while the
faithful Monk carried another. A few days later
a party of whites visited the scene and buried their
dead. The Indians had carefully removed their slain
but left the whites unmolested. Wallace Estill, Monk's
young master, gave him his freedom and cared for
him the remainder of his life. He lived to a ripe old
age and was the father of thirty children.</p>

<p>The little city of Mount Sterling is near the battleground
where such heroism was displayed by both
savage and civilian.</p>

<p>Daniel Boone, the famous hunter, fighter, and
pioneer, regarded himself as a special agent intended
by providence to convert forests into fields and to
carry civilization to the wilderness. When we remember
his many exciting adventures and marvelous
successes, we are inclined almost to believe that he
was a child of destiny.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<span class="caption">&quot;He took aim at the foremost.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>One of the most singular experiences in his warfare
on the savages occurred about 1780, when about
two miles south of Owingsville. Boone was making
one of his solitary journeys from Boonesborough to
the Upper Blue Licks. As he came near a deserted
station about twelve miles east of the present site
of Mount Sterling, he perceived fresh signs of Indians;
so he continued his journey cautiously until he came
to a clear spring near the bank of Slate Creek. Here,
as he was quenching his thirst, a ball whistled by
and broke the bark from the beech that shaded the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
spring. Boone lost no time in reaching the creek,
swimming to the opposite bank, and concealing himself
in a convenient canebrake. He then cautiously
parted the cane until he had gone about one hundred
yards, when he observed two Indians coming warily
towards the creek. He had slain so many savages
that he was not satisfied with the thought of killing
one of his adversaries, but determined that one shot
should kill both. He therefore took aim at the foremost
and as the other came in range he fired; and as
one fell dead, the other, dropping his gun, fled with
frantic yells of pain, for the ball had passed through
the body of one and struck the other's shoulder.</p>

<p>Boone then very calmly crossed the creek, selected
one of the guns left by the savages, threw the other in
the creek, where it was found afterwards, and proceeded
on his way to the Blue Licks.</p>

<p>His father having died when he was only fourteen,
Benjamin Logan found himself, according to the laws
of Virginia, at the head of a family, and in possession
of his father's estate. With his mother's consent he
sold the land and divided the proceeds among his
brothers and sisters. Since he wished to see his
mother comfortably settled, he united funds with
that of a brother and bought a small home, which
was secured to her during her life.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>Bidding his mother farewell, he soon made for himself
a home on the Holston River. Here he remained
a few years and after having served with both Colonel
Bouquet and Colonel Dunmore in the expeditions
against the Indians, resolved to try the western wilds
of Kentucky. With two or three slaves, he came,
traversed a great part of the wilderness with Boone
and Henderson, and pitched his camp and built his
fort in Lincoln County near the present city of Stanford.
Bringing out his family the next year, he
deemed it prudent to place them in the more securely
fortified Harrodstown. But early in 1777 feeling more
assurance of safety, he removed all his household to
his new home.</p>

<p>Early in the morning of May 20, while some of
the men were guarding the women as they were outside
milking, Indians fired on them from a near-by
canebrake. All fled toward the fort, but one of the
white men fell dead, another was mortally wounded,
and a third, Burr Harrison, was severely crippled.
There were now only twelve fighting men to defend
the fort, while the enemy numbered one hundred.
Harrison ran staggering towards the fort, when he
fell and lay all day within range of the rifles of the
Indians, and in sight of his agonized wife; her pleas
for help and cries of distress, as from her own place
of safety she saw her husband wounded and helpless,
touched the sympathy and tried the heroism of
all.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<span class="caption">&quot;Amid a shower of arrows they entered the gate.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>All hesitated until twilight came, and it grew so
dark the Indians could not distinguish objects moving
around the stockade. As there were a great many
large hogs in the vicinity, Logan covered himself
with a small feather bed, made from the feathers of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
the numerous wild pigeons, turkeys, and geese, and
leaving the gate crept hither and thither, on all fours,
grunting and acting as if in search of something to
eat. Finally he reached Harrison, apparently by
accident. He suddenly seized him in his arms, sprang
to his feet, and darted toward the fort before the
surprised Indians sufficiently recovered to take sure
aim. Amid a shower of bullets and arrows he and
Harrison entered the gate in safety.</p>

<p>Enraged at the deception practiced upon them,
the Indians vigorously assaulted the fort, while the
inmates as vigorously defended it. Under Logan's
lead they resolved to fight to the last, but the powder
and ball began to run low. What should be done?
These men, made of "sterner stuff," faced another
danger. If the siege was continued, they must perish
or procure ammunition.</p>

<p>Again the heroism of Logan shone forth. Assuring
his wife and friends of a safe and speedy return, he,
with two trusty companions, under the cover of the
night, left the fort. They crept through the Indian
lines, avoided the regular route through Cumberland
Gap, rapidly traversed mountains and valleys, crossed
rivers, pushed through brush and cane, reached the
Holston, procured "powder and ball," and on the
tenth night Logan reëntered the fort, having traveled
more than three hundred miles. His companions soon
arrived with the ammunition, reënforcements were
brought, and the Indians retired.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<span class="caption">&quot;Mr. Rowan turned the butt of his gun.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>About 1784, a party of pioneers left the Falls of
the Ohio with the intention of descending the river.
Reaching Yellow Banks, the boat stopped for a while.
One of the party, a Mr. Rowan, taking a loaded gun,
but no ammunition, wandered some distance from the
shore and upon his return was astonished to find the
boat gone. The crew had cause to believe a party of
Indians was near, so hastened away without waiting
for their comrade. The nearest settlement was at
Vincennes, one hundred miles distant. So thither
Mr. Rowan bent his steps until after three weary
days of exposure and exhaustion he abandoned all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
hope and lay down to die. It was not long, however,
before, hearing the report of a gun, he again took
courage, rose, and made his way in the direction of
the sound. When he came in sight, an Indian raised
his gun to fire, but, seeing Mr. Rowan turn the butt
of his gun, knew he meant to be friendly; so with a
politeness that would have done honor to a civilian
the savage promptly turned the butt of his also.</p>

<p>Learning the destitute condition of Rowan, the
Indian hospitably took him to his wigwam, cared for
him until his strength was restored, and then conducted
him to Vincennes. Anxious to reward such
unusual kindness, Rowan tried to prevail on the savage
to accept a gift of $300; of this the Indian nobly
refused every penny, but in order to please his recent
guest finally accepted a new blanket, saying, "When
I wrap myself in it, I will think of you."</p>

<h2><a name="SAVED_BY_THE_HUG_OF_A_BEAR" id="SAVED_BY_THE_HUG_OF_A_BEAR"></a>SAVED BY THE HUG OF A BEAR</h2>


<p>Though the records of pioneer life teem with startling
encounters with wild animals, there really occurred
a very unusual incident, when the life of a young man,
named Downing, was saved by the hug of a bear.</p>

<p>In those early days, the people of that part of the
country that is now Kentucky had to content themselves
with very rough cabins and forts for their
families, and with no outbuildings or inclosures whatever
for their stock.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>Instead of well-kept stables and excellent pastures,
the stockade protected the cows, sheep, and horses
at night, and the near-by forest was their home and
grazing ground during the day. Although as close
watch as possible was kept over these animals, they
sometimes strayed so far away that it was necessary
to bring them back or the Indians would take them for
their own.</p>

<p>In the year 1786, in what is now Bath County, a
horse had strayed off, and a young man named Yates
requested another occupant of the fort, a mere lad
named Downing, to go with him in search of the animal.</p>

<p>They traversed the woods in every direction all day,
but in vain. About sundown, when nearly seven miles
from the fort, in a wild valley, Downing became very
anxious concerning sounds that seemed to follow his
footsteps regardless of the direction he took. He
repeatedly said that he heard sticks breaking and that
he believed Indians were following them.</p>

<p>Yates, who was older, more experienced, and more
inured to the perils of frontier life, laughed heartily
at the fears of his companion, often inquired at what
price he rated his scalp, and jokingly offered to insure
it at a sixpence.</p>

<p>Oblivious to all danger, enjoying the discomfort of
his companion, and wishing to display his daring,
Yates began a rollicking tune as he boldly passed
along; but young Downing, feeling "the better
part of valor is discretion," and being sure from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
ominous sounds that they were being followed, decided
to discover if possible the hidden foe. He gradually
slackened his pace, until his companion was about
twenty or thirty yards in advance; then just after
descending a small hill, Downing quickly stepped from
the path and secreted himself behind some bushes.
He was horrified a few moments later to see two Indians
cautiously put aside the canebrake and peer in
the direction taken by his companion.</p>

<p>Downing, fearful lest the savages knew his own
hiding place, decided to fire upon them at once; but
his hand was so unsteady from the excitement, that
his gun went off before he took aim. Terror-stricken
he fled in the direction taken by his friend, whom he
soon met, returning to learn the cause of the firing.
There was no need to inquire, for in full view the two
savages were rapidly pursuing them.</p>

<p>True Kentucky chivalry was soon evident, for though
he could easily have saved himself, Yates would not
outrun his young companion, but kept by his side.</p>

<p>It so happened that a path diverged from the one
taken by the whites, but rejoined it at a distant point.
Knowing the country well, the Indians took this
divergent path, expecting to intercept the pioneers at
the point of reunion. Passing this point in safety,
the white men soon came to a deep gully. Mr. Yates
easily cleared it, but his companion, being very much
exhausted, fell against the farther bank and rolled at
full length to the bottom. He gave himself up for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
lost. Over went the two Indians like deer, so intent
upon catching the foremost man they apparently
did not notice Downing.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 592px;">
<img src="images/ill-0110.jpg" width="592" height="660" alt="&quot;The bear growled and hugged him close.&quot;" title="" />
<span class="caption">&quot;The bear growled and hugged him close.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>For a while fear kept him still, but finally thinking
the Indians were far away, the young man walked
to the shallow part of the ditch. Just as he reached a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
place so shallow that he was no longer concealed, to
his astonishment and dismay he beheld one of the
savages returning, apparently in search of him.</p>

<p>Having neglected to reload his gun, and seeing the
Indian advancing upon him, he threw it away and
again trusted to flight. The white man ran and the
Indian ran. It was a race for life, but as they ascended
the long ridge, so steadily did the Indian gain upon
him that when Downing ran along one side of a big
fallen poplar, the Indian passed along the other, evidently
expecting to seize him at the upturned root.
However, just there lay a huge mother bear and her
cubs. So rapidly was the Indian running that by the
time he had discovered Mrs. Bruin, she had discovered
him; and though his salutation was an exclamation
of horror and a plunge of his great knife, the bear only
growled and hugged him close.</p>

<p>So happy was Downing over this timely meeting of
his two enemies, that he joyfully fled to the fort,
where he found his companion resting from his exciting
race. Those in the fort soon received a vivid account
of how Downing's life, providentially, had been saved
by the hug of a bear.</p>

<h2><a name="A_KENTUCKIAN_DEFEATED_THE_BRITISH" id="A_KENTUCKIAN_DEFEATED_THE_BRITISH"></a>A KENTUCKIAN DEFEATED THE BRITISH</h2>


<p>There was born in Virginia, on November 19, 1752,
a light-haired, blue-eyed baby boy who was destined
to become the founder of our commonwealth, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
father of Kentucky, and the captor of England's
important outposts.</p>

<p>Leaving his home one spring morning in 1775, and
stopping at the bend of the road to wave farewell to
his mother, sister, and brother, George Rogers Clark,
a young soldier-surveyor of twenty-two who had
seen active service in Dunmore's war, started out for
the wilds of Kentucky.</p>

<p>More than six feet in height, dignified, affable,
manly, brave, determined, yet gentle, he at once
commanded not only the attention, but respect, friendship,
and leadership of all. Whether or not he came
with an official commission, his military bearing, his
superior intelligence, and his indomitable spirit caused
him by common consent to be placed at the head of
the irregular militia of this section.</p>

<p>George Rogers Clark returned to Virginia in the
autumn, but in the memorable year of '76 came again
to Kentucky to make it his permanent home.</p>

<p>He opposed the plans of the Transylvania Company,
urged the settlers to try to effect a more certain
connection with Virginia, and went over mountains,
through mud, and amid difficulties and dangers, as a
representative to the Virginia legislature, which had
adjourned before he reached the capital.</p>

<p>Not to be deterred, he visited Governor Patrick
Henry, who was at home sick, and impressed upon
him the necessity of protecting the settlements in
Kentucky. He then went before the executive council<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
of the state and asked for 500 pounds of gunpowder
to be used in defense of the stations. The council
agreed to lend this to the colonists as friends, but said
they could not give it to them as fellow citizens. At
this Clark refused to accept the gunpowder and
intimated intentions of appealing for assistance elsewhere,
saying that, "A country that is not worth
defending is not worth having." This reply caused
the recall of Clark to the presence of the council, and
the gunpowder was conveyed to Pittsburgh and delivered
to Clark for the colonists.</p>

<p>At the next session of the legislature, through the
splendid services of this same useful citizen, the territory
which later became our commonwealth was
erected into Kentucky County, of Virginia.</p>

<p>From this time on Clark was, by common consent,
the moving master spirit in all the daring plans of his
adopted state. With a seeing eye and an unsurpassed
judgment he concluded that the Indian invasions
were inspired by the British and that to stop this terrible
warfare the colonists should strike at the fountain
head. Accordingly he laid and perfected his plans
for attacking the posts of Kaskaskia, Cahokia, and
Saint Vincents (now Vincennes). Virginia voted to
defray the expenses and gave Clark two sets of instructions,
one public, ordering him to proceed to
the defense of Kentucky, the other private, ordering
an attack on Kaskaskia.</p>

<p>Descending the Ohio on flatboats or pirogues, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
landed, May, 1778, three companies of troops and several
families on Corn Island, near the Falls of the Ohio.
He drilled his raw recruits, reënforced with volunteers
from the country, and a few weeks later, amid a total
eclipse of the sun, set out with his frail fleet of four
companies of one hundred and thirty-five fighting men.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 660px;">

<span class="caption">&quot;On the night of July 4, they captured Kaskaskia.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>Landing on Owen's Island near the mouth of the
Tennessee River, and striking across the country
from Fort Massacre, or Massac, he began that wonderful
march which won him undying fame.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>Meeting a party of hunters recently from Kaskaskia,
Clark secured from them important intelligence and
an offer to guide his forces where by a sudden surprise
they believed the place could be easily captured. On
the night of July 4, he took the town of two hundred
and fifty inhabitants without the loss of one drop of
blood.</p>

<p>Most of the people were of French descent and had
been taught by the British that the Kentuckians
waged savage warfare. They were therefore terror-stricken
until General Clark assured them that their
own king, whose rule over them had been exchanged
for that of the British by the treaty of Paris, 1763,
had joined hands with America to stop the cruel war
of the British and Indians. The French colonists
were then overjoyed, said their French king had come
to life, and offered to accompany the division that was
to march to Cahokia.</p>

<p>On July 6, that post was also surprised and taken;
the inhabitants were dreadfully alarmed at the sight
of the "big knife," but were soon reassured by their
relatives and friends from Kaskaskia.</p>

<p>Not satisfied with these brilliant successes, General
Clark felt that he must also capture Vincennes, but
M. Gibault, the village priest of both that place and
Kaskaskia, volunteered to inform the people of Vincennes
that the king of France had become an ally
of the American colonists. Soon the American flag
floated over that fort and from the Lakes to the Mississippi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
the powerful arm of the British was broken,
and the many Indian invasions of Kentucky were discontinued.</p>



<p><br /><br /><br /></p>
<h2><a name="A_FAMOUS_MARCH" id="A_FAMOUS_MARCH"></a>A FAMOUS MARCH</h2>


<p>News came to General Clark in January of 1779,
that the British under Governor Hamilton from Detroit
had recaptured Vincennes and were waiting only till
spring to advance with hundreds of Indian allies on
Kaskaskia, obliterate the Kentuckians, and break the
power of Virginia west of the Alleghenies. Learning
at the same time that Hamilton had only about eighty
regular soldiers with three cannons and some swivels,
Clark decided not to wait to be attacked, but to take
the aggressive. He at once sent forty-five men on a
boat to proceed to a point near the mouth of the
White River with instructions, to allow nothing to
pass, and to wait further orders.</p>

<p>Nine days after the important information reached
him, General Clark with one hundred and seventy men
started across flooded prairies, swollen streams, and
inundated valleys. There is no more daring march
recorded. Trudging through rain and mud, fording
small streams, wading most of the time in deep water
ofttimes to the armpits, they traveled without tents,
depending on parched corn and the securing of game
for food; at last they went for days with no nourishment
whatever.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 660px;">

<span class="caption">Clark and his men crossing a swollen stream.</span>
</div>

<p>It took all the ingenuity of General Clark to keep
up the courage of the soldiers. Sometimes he would
plunge into the deep water singing a favorite song,
when all would join in, fall in line, and sing as
they waded. At another time, seeing the discouragement
and despair in their faces, he blackened his face
with gunpowder, gave an Indian-like war whoop, and
plunged into the stream; again all followed. At another
place a little drummer boy was placed on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
shoulders of a tall man and told to beat as if for his
life. The enthusiasm of the boy and his stirring music
quickly renewed the courage of the soldiers. A division
was placed in the rear with orders to shoot any
who "dropped out," and the march was continued
through the freezing waters.</p>

<p>Near Vincennes, they captured a Frenchman who
had been duck shooting, and sent a letter by him to
the French inhabitants saying that the fort would be
stormed that night and they could choose between
remaining quietly in their homes and receiving the
friendly protection of the assaulters, or of going into
the British fort and of abiding results.</p>

<p>All was then commotion and people rushed out
from their houses to learn the news. By a stratagem
of Clark's his men were so marching in a circle behind
an elevation that as they passed and repassed,
flying many "colors," each man was counted dozens
of times, and the inhabitants of the place thought
there was an attacking force of many hundreds of
people at their gates.</p>

<p>For two days and nights, Clark's men besieged the
fort. Their ammunition ran alarmingly low, yet Clark,
Napoleon-like, was very demanding. At last the "Stars
and Stripes" floated again over Vincennes, and thus
was secured to our nation that vast tract out of which
have been carved Michigan, Wisconsin, Ohio, Indiana,
and Illinois, while the value to the colonists in Kentucky
could not be easily estimated.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="THE_FIRST_CHRISTMAS_PARTY" id="THE_FIRST_CHRISTMAS_PARTY"></a>THE FIRST CHRISTMAS PARTY</h2>


<p>When General George Rogers Clark had conquered
the British and Indians in their stronghold in the
Illinois country, he felt it safe for the few families he
had left on Corn Island, near the Falls of the Ohio,
to remove to the mainland, and so ordered that a fort
be built there.</p>

<p>Rows of log cabins joined together around a hollow
square constituted this structure; at one corner there
was a cabin, double the size of the others, that was to
serve as a storeroom. In this building took place the
first Christmas dinner and dance in Kentucky, as far
as any record shows.</p>

<p>The men ranged the forest and brought home rabbits,
turkeys, deer, bears, and buffaloes. The women baked
corn pone, hoecake and johnnycake, boiled and fried
hominy, and prepared milk, butter, and cheese.</p>

<p>Forks were driven into the earthen floor of the storehouse.
On rough, unhewn, uncovered boards laid
above poles stretched between the forks, the feast was
served. Wooden platters held the meats, wooden
plates the bread, and wooden bowls the hominy. The
centerpiece that decorated the table and proved the
great dish of the banquet was an opossum baked
whole, hanging by its tail on a stick of wood, which
was suspended over the center.</p>

<p>The fiddler of the fort, an old negro named Cato, as
well as every man, woman, and child, had been downcast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
for some time because the fiddle had only one
string left. Patient Cato had tried horsehair and deer
sinews, but no music could thus be made. Fortunately
on Christmas eve a small boat landed near the fort
and on it was a Frenchman with a violin.</p>

<span class="caption">&quot;The Frenchman retired in a rage.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>It did not take old Cato long to inquire if the musician<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
had any extra strings he would sell; learning that he
had, Cato joyfully exchanged raccoon skins for the
coveted strings, and gave the stranger an extra skin
to tell nothing about the trade. Cato was intending to
give the settlers a great surprise. Alas for his dreams!
The traders from the boat being invited to the feast,
the Frenchman happened to speak of an accident to his
fiddle; whereupon he was besieged with requests to get
his instrument and play, so they could dance. He reluctantly
yielded, the table was cleared away, the older
people and children ranged themselves around the walls,
and the younger men and women impatiently waited
on the smooth, dirt floor, until the music began.</p>

<p>The Frenchman tried in vain to teach the fashionable
dances of his homeland to the backwoods boys and
girls. At last, becoming discouraged and disgusted, he
retired in a rage. Then the old darkey approached him
and politely asked if he might play while his honor
rested. He was told to "play on."</p>

<p>Soon to the music of old Cato's fiddle, the boys and
girls were making merry by dancing the Virginia reel.
Not till the midnight hour did either the dancers or
fiddler weary or pause.</p>

<h2><a name="FORT_JEFFERSON" id="FORT_JEFFERSON"></a>FORT JEFFERSON</h2>


<p>Thomas Jefferson, the Sage of Monticello, the
originator of many plans for the defense and perpetuation
of our country, deserves a place of honor in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
records of Kentucky, for the interest shown in this,
the then remote part of Virginia.</p>

<p>In a message in 1778, Governor Patrick Henry of
Virginia suggested that a post be established and fortified
on the Mississippi; but it was Governor Jefferson
of the same state who later expressly said that the plan
must be executed.</p>

<p>Spain and France for years were zealous in their
efforts to check the extension of the infant republic,
control the great Mississippi, and make of Kentucky
a Spanish province. Her geographical position and
great river frontage caused them to realize her wonderful
resources. So, to fortify the claim of the United
States to the Mississippi as its western boundary,
Thomas Jefferson, Governor of Virginia, engaged Dr.
Thomas Walker with an able corps of surveyors to ascertain
the point on the Mississippi River intersected by
the southern limit of Virginia. He then, in 1780, instructed
General George Rogers Clark to establish a
fort and garrison near that point and afterwards to
extend a line of forts to the north, both to offer protection
and to establish possession. So in the summer of
1780, General Clark with 200 soldiers erected and
manned with cannons a fort at a point about five miles
below where Cairo now is and near Wickliffe, Kentucky.
Adverse criticisms fell from many because of
this division and depletion of forces, but as in all
other enterprises with which he was connected, Jefferson
built not for the present alone but for the future as well.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>By an oversight Clark and his soldiers failed to follow
Jefferson's instructions to secure from the Chickasaw
Indians, who owned the land west of the Tennessee
River, the consent to the erection of the fort. They
thereby aroused a spark of resentment that erelong
became such a flame that the Indians began harassing
and killing the families outside the fort. By threat
of death, they forced one captive to describe the true
state of the fort, in which, to their surprise, they learned
there were only about thirty men and two thirds of these
were sick with malaria. Soon the Indians marched,
one thousand two hundred strong, under the command
of a Scotchman named Colbert; but for five
days these weakened frontiersmen with little water
and less food, except green pumpkins, held the
fort.</p>

<p>Finally Captains Clark and Colbert met under a
flag of truce, but failed to agree to terms. The fort
even refused a demand to surrender, though told that
the assistance they expected would not reach them.
As night fell the Indians made a desperate assault,
but the firing from one of the blockhouses so depleted
and demoralized their ranks that they retreated.
Reënforcements arrived soon after and the siege was
abandoned.</p>

<p>Though Fort Jefferson from its isolated position was
finally forsaken, yet "its evacuation was a signal for
peace," and the Indians here no longer molested the
white settlers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>



<p><br /><br /><br /></p>
<h2><a name="THE_HARD_WINTER" id="THE_HARD_WINTER"></a>"THE HARD WINTER"</h2>


<p>From November to March, 1779-1780, the settlers
of Kentucky suffered untold anguish from the severity
of the weather and the scarcity of food. More pioneers
had come into the wilderness the preceding summer
and so increased the population that the products of
garden, field, and forest were soon exhausted.</p>

<p>Deep, unmelting snow covered the land; many
families coming by river were caught in the masses of
ice, compelled to abandon their primitive boats, and
encamp on the frozen shore; while the traveler by
land found trails blocked with snow, creeks frozen
solid, and the forest desolate. Horses, cattle, and
many wild animals froze or died from want of nourishment,
while so great was the extremity that the settlers
were forced to eat the flesh of the animals that had
thus fallen, and for months had to go without bread.
In this severe cold, through the deep snow and over
the solid ice, there could be little traveling. To secure
supplies from elsewhere was impossible; and even
when spring began to bring some relief, one bushel of
corn brought, in the continental currency, from fifty to
one hundred and seventy-five dollars. Complete relief
could not come until the seedtime and the harvest
home were over.</p>

<p>The Pilgrims were not more grateful on their first
Thanksgiving Day than were the Kentucky frontiersmen
when plenty again abounded.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>



<p><br /><br /><br /></p>
<h2><a name="WILDCAT_McKINNEY" id="WILDCAT_McKINNEY"></a>WILDCAT McKINNEY</h2>


<p>Though the pioneers of Kentucky endured many
murderous attacks from the Indians, there were other
dangers which were not trifling. One of the most
exciting of these incidents was the experience of a
man named John McKinney, who was employed at an
early day by the people of Lexington, as their first
teacher.</p>

<p>At that time Kentucky had no newspaper, and items
of interest from the states beyond the mountains were
eagerly greeted by all. In May, 1783, a traveler
passing through the embryo city of what is now the
capital of our famed blue-grass section, brought with
him a newspaper containing the Articles of Peace with
Great Britain. All were anxious to read them. The
fact that the Articles had not yet been ratified did not
lessen the interest of the citizens. A copy of any paper
was a treat, and such news as the Articles meant great
hope for the struggling settlers. As the gentleman
would resume his journey the following day and take
with him the much-prized paper, some of the citizens
appealed to McKinney to copy the Articles of Peace.</p>

<p>At that time Lexington was only a cluster of about
thirty cabins, and one which stood just outside the fort,
near the present site of the courthouse, was used as a
schoolroom.</p>

<p>Thither, the next morning, the teacher went to copy
the precious news of peace. While busily writing, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
heard a noise and glancing up saw a very unusual and
unwelcome guest. A ferocious wildcat with bristles
erect, tail curled, and eyes flashing, had paused on the
threshold and was peering around the room. At first
she did not see McKinney, but by some involuntary
movement he attracted her attention, and she soon
exhibited other than friendly emotions.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 645px;">
<img src="images/ill-0126.jpg" width="645" height="660" alt="&quot;The wildcat was not to be frowned down.&quot;" title="" />
<span class="caption">&quot;The wildcat was not to be frowned down.&quot;</span>
</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>Having been accustomed to subdue the backwoods
boys and girls by the awfulness of his frown, the
teacher tried the same tactics now; but the cat was
not to be frowned down. As the teacher reached for
a rule she, with the ferocity of a lion, sprang upon
him, fastened her claws in his side, and began tearing
his clothes, mangling his flesh, and inflicting such
serious wounds that the blood flowed copiously.</p>

<p>Knowing he could not long withstand her power
and despairing of aught else to do, he threw his weight
upon her and pressed her against the sharp corner of
the table. Soon her weird cries were mingled with his
calls of distress, and erelong the citizens knew something
unusual was happening in the little schoolhouse. The
women were first to answer the cry of alarm. Reaching
the door, they paused to discover the cause of the
commotion and seeing Mr. McKinney bending over
the table, writhing and groaning, they at first glance
thought that he had a severe attack of cramp, but
quickly seeing the cat, one lady exclaimed, "Why, Mr.
McKinney, what is the matter?"</p>

<p>He very gravely replied, "Madam, I have caught a
cat."</p>

<p>By this time the cat was lifeless; but her teeth were
so deeply imbedded in his side that the neighbors,
many of whom had gathered by this time, had great
difficulty in disengaging her.</p>

<p>The shock, the wound, and the loss of blood made
McKinney very sick and weak, and for several days<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
he was confined to his bed while the boys and girls
enjoyed a holiday.</p>

<p>He lived to a ripe old age and was often heard to say
he would rather fight two Indians than one wildcat.</p>

<h2><a name="HOW_KENTUCKY_WAS_FORMED" id="HOW_KENTUCKY_WAS_FORMED"></a>HOW KENTUCKY WAS FORMED</h2>


<p>When "the embattled farmers stood and fired the
shot heard round the world," Kentucky was that portion
of the "Old Dominion" that was destined to be
the happy homes of so many men, valorous in the
field and eloquent in the forum. The state to be, whose
toast and boast has ever been her noble sons and fair
daughters, was still called Fincastle County, Virginia.</p>

<p>The last day of 1776, the year that saw the sons of
the colonies rise in the majesty of their manhood and
declare they would no longer submit to the rule of
King George, the Virginia legislature divided Fincastle
County into three counties, and called one of them
Kentucky. This so remained until May, 1780, when
Kentucky County was divided into Jefferson, Fayette,
and Lincoln. Then the name of Kentucky was
abandoned until in 1783, when an act of the Virginia
legislature united the three counties into Kentucky
District. On March 3, 1783, the first court convened
at Harrodstown; but no house there being large enough,
a church, six miles distant, was the home of the first
judicial proceedings.</p>

<p>An act of this court caused a log jail and courthouse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
to be built where Danville now stands. Immigrants
continued to come to this "Eden of the West" and the
three original counties were divided and subdivided
until June 1, 1792, when Kentucky became the fifteenth
star in the constellation. There were then nine counties
with a total population of 100,000; from this embryo
has come a commonwealth of one hundred and twenty
counties, with an area of four thousand square miles, rich
in minerals and timber, factories and fields.</p>

<p>From the mountains of the east and the blue grass
of the central part, even to the "Pennyrile" of the far
west, each son of the "Dark and Bloody Ground"
loves the land settled by Boone, Kenton, and Clark.</p>

<h2><a name="KENTUCKY_IN_THE_REVOLUTION" id="KENTUCKY_IN_THE_REVOLUTION"></a>KENTUCKY IN THE REVOLUTION</h2>


<p>The youth of our state may feel that because Kentucky
was not one of the original Thirteen Colonies to
make the heroic struggle for freedom, that she played
no part in establishing and extending our national
government.</p>

<p>During this period, remote as was this part of Virginia
from the centers of civilization, every road blazed,
every settlement made, every victory over the red
savage, had a far-reaching effect, not alone for the
state in embryo, but for the national government.</p>

<p>Had not the pioneers of Kentucky, with the heroism
of the Romans of old, subdued the savages, stopped
their depredations, and secured to the mother state of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
Virginia that vast tract out of which have been carved
Michigan, Wisconsin, Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois, the
power of England, to-day, might cut our continent
in two.</p>

<p>Kentuckians waited not for opportunity but made it.</p>

<p>At the battle of Point Pleasant, in October, 1774,
where the noted "Cornstalk" met defeat, there were
with General Andrew Lewis men whose name and
fame furnish much of Kentucky history. There were
Harrod, the Shelbys, the Boones, and other intrepid
leaders who afterwards brought out from chaos our
infant commonwealth.</p>

<p>The effect of this battle was more than local. It
gave peace to the frontiersmen at the time the colonies
were beginning the crucial contest with England and
for a while prevented that barbaric warfare waged by
the British and Indians united. So severe was the
slaughter, it is said, that blood was found on each tree
behind which the Indians and pioneers were posted.</p>

<p>In 1780 one of our pioneers who afterwards became
our first governor, Colonel Isaac Shelby, was again in
Kentucky locating lands that some time before he had
marked out and improved, when he heard of the surrender
of Charleston. A man with a soul so fired
with patriotism could not be contented not to answer
his country's call. He hurried home, secured volunteers,
and did signal service in both North and South
Carolina, and in Georgia. In a measure he overcame
the defeat of Gates at Camden; by his momentous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
move, though not in supreme command, Colonel
Shelby will ever be known as the hero of Kings Mountain,
where the enemy surrendered after Ferguson with
seventy-five officers and men had been killed.</p>

<p>This was at the darkest hour of the Revolution and
has been called "the first link in the great chain of
events in the South that established the independence
of the United States." These conquests by Shelby in
the South, coupled with those of Clark at Kaskaskia,
Cahokia, and Vincennes, were as important in both
immediate and future results as any that illumine the
pages of the Revolution.</p>

<h2><a name="KENTUCKYS_PIONEER_HISTORIAN" id="KENTUCKYS_PIONEER_HISTORIAN"></a>KENTUCKY'S PIONEER HISTORIAN</h2>


<p>To view Kentucky in its primeval beauty and rugged
grandeur; to talk face to face with Boone, Harrod,
Todd, Cowan, and Kennedy, those hardy hunters who
blazed the way and changed the uncertain trail to a
broad thoroughfare through the western wilds; to
experience the difficulties and encounter the dangers
of those dreadful days&mdash;were experiences for one who
would essay to write a history of the country, the
times, and the people. Yet such were the advantages
enjoyed by Kentucky's earliest historian, John Filson.</p>

<p>Born in Pennsylvania in 1747, given a common
school and academic education, lured either by the
spirit of adventure, the locating of lands, or the enthusiastic
reports of the far-famed "second paradise"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
with its "happy climate and plentiful soil," Filson
reached Lexington in 1782. Here he succeeded "Wildcat
McKinney" as the second teacher in this "Athens
of the West."</p>

<p>While engaged in teaching, Filson was securing information
that was to give to the world, not only the
first history of Kentucky, but the first authentic
account of that vast, transmontane wilderness about
which so many exciting experiences had been recounted.</p>

<p>It has been said, "he could ask more questions and
answer fewer than any one of his time."</p>

<p>Active, observant, accurate, he gave, in his "Discovery,
Settlement, and Present State of Kentucky,"
in 1784, a work of much merit. It contained the first
map ever drawn of this state, showing the three original
counties of Jefferson, Fayette, and Lincoln.</p>

<p>As this was before any printing presses had been
set up in Kentucky or at any other point in the West,
Filson carried his map to Philadelphia and his manuscript
to Wilmington, Delaware.</p>

<span class="caption">John Filson.</span>
</div>

<p>This little book of one hundred and eighteen pages was
deemed of such consequence that one year after its
appearance, it was translated into French and published
by M. Parraud at Paris. Three editions were printed
in England by Gilbert Imlay, Kentucky's first novelist,
who incorporated it in his "Topographical Description
of the Western Territory."</p>

<p>Not only was Filson a historian, biographer, and
teacher, but he was also a practical, skillful surveyor.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>He led a restless, strenuous life. Soon after his first
visit to Kentucky he was back on his native heath,
again in the state of his adoption, next in the Illinois
country gathering
data for a history
of that section, the
manuscripts of which
are now the property
of the Wisconsin
Historical Society.</p>

<p>In 1788 Filson
was associated with
Mathias Denman
and Robert Patterson,
the founder of
Lexington, in the
purchase of a tract of
eight hundred acres
opposite the mouth
of the Licking River,
where they planned
a town, now the city of Cincinnati, but named by
Filson, Losantiville,&mdash;the "city opposite the mouth of
the Licking."</p>

<p>As the party deferred surveying and staking off lots
for a while, Filson's restless spirit again urged him on;
and, after surveying the Great Miami with a party, he
ventured still farther alone and was never seen again.
His friends supposed he was killed by the Indians;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
but there is no record of the time, place, or manner of
his death, and nothing to mark his grave. His name
has been aptly given to that body of earnest, eminent
workers of Louisville, the Filson Club, who have done
so much to collect and preserve the many interesting
facts about Kentucky's early days.</p>

<h2><a name="SPANISH_CONSPIRACY" id="SPANISH_CONSPIRACY"></a>SPANISH CONSPIRACY</h2>


<p>Kentucky, the land of soldiers and statesmen, has
erected in the hearts of her patriotic sons a monument,
ever enduring, to Clark, Logan, Bowman, Scott, Shelby,
Hardin, and scores of others whose work and courage
won for us this fair domain. It can be truly said of
each:</p>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i3">"An empire is his sepulcher,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">His epitaph is fame."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Though these brave men had conquered the wild
beasts and barbarous red men, there were still other
forces to meet. When this far-away West, between the
Alleghenies and the Mississippi River, began to prosper,
homes were built, forests became fields, and products
sought a market. As railroads were undreamed of,
nature's method of transportation was their only outlet.
To be able to load a flatboat with corn and
other Kentucky crops, and float down the Ohio and the
"Father of Waters" to New Orleans, would have made
that city a great haven for the western pioneers. But
Spain owned the mouth, and though Great Britain had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
ceded us free navigation of the river, Spain in the early
nineties refused the free navigation and the right to
deposit at New Orleans. Subsequent events will disclose
how long this privilege was withheld.</p>

<p>We have elsewhere told how out of Fincastle County,
Virginia, 1776, the county of Kentucky was erected,
while in 1780 it was divided into the counties of Fayette,
Jefferson, and Lincoln, and in 1783 they were united
into a Kentucky District. But so far removed was this
district from the capital of the commonwealth, so insurmountable
were the natural barriers at that time,
so inadequate was the mother state to protect the
pioneers, that they began seriously to consider a separation
and the erection of another member of the
general government. Yet so great was their love for
Virginia, it was only with the most delicate suggestion
they began. Convention after convention met and
adjourned with nothing more accomplished than a
postponement of the desire nearest their hearts.</p>

<p>Vainly the people who had subdued this wilderness
petitioned. Futile were the efforts of the national
Congress or of the commonwealth of Virginia to grant
their prayers. We can scarcely censure General
James Wilkinson for wishing to cut the "Gordian knot
of difficulty" by immediate separation and the erection
of an independent government. At the same time the
subtle music of the siren's song fell upon the ears of
those who had won their homes through privations.</p>

<p>In June, 1785, Don Gardoqui was sent by the Spanish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
government to treat with the American government on
any subject of dispute. The Honorable John Jay was
commissioned to meet him, but the far-seeing members
of Congress fortunately put the following check upon
Mr. Jay: "That he enter into no treaty, compact,
nor convention whatever with the said representative
of Spain, which did not stipulate the right of the United
States to the navigation of the Mississippi and boundaries
as established by their treaty with Great Britain."</p>

<p>In a few months, Jay urged upon Congress a commercial
treaty, which would, he claimed, redound to
the benefit of the United States; the consideration on
her part was "she should forbear the use of the navigation
of the Mississippi for twenty-five or thirty years."
Jay, that had stood "like a stone wall" at Madrid and
Paris, was now willing to barter away the privileges
of the nation for a mere sectional gain. Happily, only
seven of the requisite nine states voted favorably, and
the chimerical plot failed. The facilities for knowing
the actions of Congress were not nearly so great then
as now; so when a communication was made, 1787,
from Pittsburgh by "A Committee of Correspondence
for Western Pennsylvania" to Kentucky pioneers, viz.:
"That John Jay, the American Secretary for Foreign
Affairs, had made a proposition to Don Gardoqui, the
Spanish minister to the United States, to cede the navigation
of the Mississippi to Spain for twenty-five or
thirty years, in consideration of some commercial
advantages to be granted to the United States; but such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
as the western country could derive no profit from,"
the effect may be easily imagined.</p>

<p>The people sent out a circular letter and prepared
to hold a convention to oppose such oppression; but
learning that the project had failed, after merely meeting
and discussing the subject, they adjourned without
any action upon it.</p>

<p>In June, 1787, General James Wilkinson secured the
privilege from General Miro, Commandante, of shipping
a vast quantity of tobacco to New Orleans annually
and of depositing it in the government's warehouse.
More than ever he now urged the importance to Kentuckians
of the free navigation of this great river,
and the right to deposit at New Orleans. Meanwhile,
the Honorable John Brown of Danville had been chosen
to represent the Kentucky District in Congress. Again
the frontiersmen were doomed to disappointment when
news came that the government had postponed the
admittance of Kentucky, indeed, would refer the question
to the new government.</p>

<p>As Don Gardoqui had failed in his scheme with John
Jay, he now very opportunely sought Representative
Brown; with what effect may be read in this part of
a letter from Mr. Brown to Samuel McDowell, president
of the various Kentucky conventions: "In a
conversation I had with Mr. Gardoqui, the Spanish
minister, relative to the navigation of the Mississippi,
he stated that, if the people of Kentucky would erect
themselves into an independent state and appoint a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
proper person to negotiate with him, he had authority
for that purpose, and would enter into an arrangement
with them for the exportation of their produce to
New Orleans on terms of mutual advantage." In a
letter to Judge Muter, Mr. Brown sets forth the
same, and in addition says: "This privilege can never
be extended to them while part of the United States,
by reason of commercial treaties existing between that
court and other powers of Europe."</p>

<p>In 1788, at Danville, sat the seventh convention
earnestly endeavoring to be loyal to both the people
and the parent state. In this assembly General Wilkinson
said: "There is one way and but one way,
that I know for obviating these difficulties, and that is
so fortified by constitutions and guarded by laws, that
it is dangerous of access and hopeless of attainment,
under present circumstances." He dilated on the
population, production, and prosperity of the country
and its inalienable rights to the Mississippi. With
natural adroitness, he caused the Honorable John Brown
to tell the convention, "That provided, we are unanimous,
everything we could wish for is within our reach."
Wilkinson also read a message he had addressed to the
"Intendant of Louisiana" wherein he urged that
should Spain persist in her refusal of the navigation of
the Mississippi and cause a resort to arms, Great Britain
would join the western people in securing it, and thus
all Spanish-America would be endangered. Whatever
individual profit Wilkinson derived from his connection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
with the Spanish authorities may be forgotten when
we realize that he and the court party he represented
would forever have fought any act to lose to Kentucky
the navigation of the Mississippi.</p>

<p>June 1, 1792, Kentucky became the fifteenth state,
and at last some of her trials were over. Still the
British retained their forts and the Indians continued
their depredations. At this time, the Revolution was
shaking France from center to circumference. Remembering
the aid of the French allies in our war for liberty
and hating England with an implacable hatred, many
of our people, especially the Kentuckians, were prepared
to rally around the French flag.</p>

<p>Democratic clubs, modeled after the Jacobean clubs
of France, sprang up; and the one at Lexington was so
urgent as to pass the following resolution:</p>

<p>"That the right of the people on the waters of the
Mississippi to the navigation thereof was undoubted,
and it ought to be peremptorily demanded of Spain
by the United States."</p>

<p>In November, 1793, the persons sent to Kentucky
by Genêt to arrange an expedition against the Spaniards
at the mouth of the Mississippi, found a field ripe for
harvest. They raised a company of two thousand
men and induced General George R. Clark, at the head
of the expedition, to accept the position of "Major
general in the armies of France and commander in chief
of the revolutionary legions on the Mississippi." He
then proceeded to call for volunteers to reduce the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
Spanish forts on the Mississippi, and open it for free
navigation. Flattering offers were made to all who
would engage. Governor Shelby of Kentucky felt it
was beyond his jurisdiction to attempt to restrain
these forces. So, early in 1794, President Washington
warned the people of the unlawfulness of such an
undertaking, and the dangers of such an expedition.
General Wayne was ordered to Fort Massac, to prevent
the descent of armed men. Soon after, Genêt was recalled,
and his acts disavowed, and Washington's
"friendship for all, but entangling alliances with none"
was the policy of the hour.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1795, Governor Carondelet of
Louisiana sent a messenger to Judge Benjamin Sebastian
of the Court of Appeals of Kentucky, requesting
him to send agents to New Madrid to negotiate with
Colonel Gayoso on the subject of the Mississippi and
regulation of commerce between the local authorities
at New Orleans and the people of Kentucky. In the
latter part of the year, Judge Sebastian went to New
Madrid, thence to New Orleans, where he secured the
promise of the navigation of the Mississippi and New
Orleans as a place of deposit, with duty payable only
on imports. Fortunately for posterity, news came that
in October, 1795, a treaty was consummated with Spain
which acknowledged the United States as extending
southward to 31°, and westward to the middle of the
Mississippi. It granted us the free navigation of that
stream and the right of deposit at New Orleans for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
period of three years, and a promise to continue these
privileges longer.</p>

<p>Whether or not the proposals of Don Gardoqui and
Baron Carondelet were merely a commercial consideration
on the part of Spain, yet dastardly in the extreme
were the futile attempts she made in 1797 to have Kentucky
withdraw from the Union, seize Fort Massac,
and become an independent government.</p>

<p>Money and arms galore were promised those infamous
enough to enter into this conspiracy to extend
the northern boundary of Spain's possessions east of
the Mississippi to the Yazoo. Again Spanish conspiracy
received a blow.</p>

<p>Though the stalwart pioneers, dressed in their
primitive suits of deerskin or homespun, pushed farther
and farther into Kentucky, stopping not for privation
or peril, danger or disaster, climbing cliffs, fording
streams, fighting savages, yet they were not all merely
unlettered backwoodsmen hunters and fighters.
Though the education of nearly all was more or less
limited, a number of these early courageous Kentuckians
have made unusual contributions to the useful
sciences. If not the birthplace, Kentucky was the home
and the burial place of a trio who can claim priority
in the invention of the steamboat.</p>

<p>In 1778 there came to Kentucky from Connecticut<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
a man of vigorous intellect and remarkable powers of
perseverance, John Fitch. He had formerly been a
silversmith, clock maker, and lieutenant in the Revolutionary
forces from New Jersey. Though made captive
by the Indians and held prisoner for a year, yet
in 1780, as he gazed upon the beautiful Ohio, he had
the first conception of overcoming currents by a new
mode of navigation. Retiring to his surveyor's camp
he pondered, and, remembering the work of Watt with
steam, concluded that boats could be propelled by the
same power.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 660px;">
<img src="images/ill-0142.jpg" width="660" height="324" alt="Fitch&#39;s steamboat." title="" />
<span class="caption">Fitch&#39;s steamboat.</span>
</div>

<p>The story of his struggles, in petitions and disappointments,
reminds one of Columbus, as he so long
in vain sought aid to make his first voyage to
America. In 1787, 1788, and 1789, Fitch built several
boats, that made from four to seven and one half miles
per hour between Philadelphia and Burlington. He
petitioned the legislatures of a number of states as well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
as England, France, and Spain, and obtained not
money, but the exclusive privileges of navigating certain
streams by boats propelled by fire or steam. He
became discouraged and finally despaired; he died at
Bardstown, 1798, where his remains rest.</p>

<p>A pathetic circumstance connected with his invention
is related. He wrote three volumes of manuscript,
sealed them, and placed them in the Philadelphia Library
to be opened thirty years after his death. When
opened, they touchingly related his disappointments,
brilliantly foretold the perfection of his plans, and
sorrowfully and bitterly said, "The day will come when
some more powerful man will get fame and riches from
my invention; but nobody will believe that poor John
Fitch can do anything worthy of attention."</p>

<p>By a coincidence two others, who chose Kentucky
as their home, James Rumsey and Edward West, also
were pioneers in this work. Both Fitch and Rumsey
in 1784 exhibited their plans to General Washington.
While Rumsey made his project public first, by means
of a model, Fitch successfully plied a boat on the
Delaware in 1785 and Rumsey on the Potomac the
following year. Fitch claimed that he told Rumsey
of his own plans to effect navigation by steam. In
1794, in the presence of hundreds of citizens, a miniature
boat invented by Edward West, who had removed
from Virginia to Lexington in 1785, proudly moved
through the waters of the town branch of the Elkhorn,
which had been dammed up near the center of the city.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>In 1802 Mr. West secured a patent not only for his
steamboat invention, but for a gun lock and a nail
cutting and heading machine, the first invention of the
kind in the world, reputed to cut five thousand three
hundred and twenty pounds of nails in twelve hours.
The patent of it sold for $10,000 and its operation
enabled Lexington to export nails of her own manufacture
to Louisville, Cincinnati, and Pittsburgh.</p>

<p>So, while it remained for Robert Fulton in 1807 to
gain honor from his invention, yet when in 1813 he
brought suit to establish his claims as the inventor of
steam navigation, he was defeated by a pamphlet of
John Fitch's, which proved conclusively there were inventions
that antedated the <i>Clermont</i>.</p>



<p><br /><br /><br /></p>
<h2><a name="OTHER_KENTUCKY_INVENTIONS" id="OTHER_KENTUCKY_INVENTIONS"></a>OTHER KENTUCKY INVENTIONS</h2>


<p>In 1792, the year that Kentucky became a state,
there came to Lexington a man named Nathan Burrows,
who was a pioneer, not only as a settler, but as an inventor
of the manufacture of hemp and a machine for
cleaning it. He failed to reap any real benefit from
this, but later manufactured a mustard that took a
premium at the World's Fair in England in 1851.</p>

<p>Another resident of Lexington, John Jones, in 1803
invented a machine for sawing stone, and a speeder
spindle.</p>

<p>It remained for a Kentuckian, Dr. Joseph Buchanan,
while a student of medicine at Lexington in 1805, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
originate the conception of the music of light to be
accomplished by means of harmonific colors, luminously
displayed, and to invent an instrument that produced
its music from glasses of different chemical composition.</p>

<p>Lexington, then the Athens of the West, was for
many years the home of a native Kentuckian, a Mr.
Barlow, whose fertile mind made him the most celebrated
of this group of interesting inventors. Having
built a steamboat at Augusta, after his removal to
Lexington, he invented in 1826-1827 a steam locomotive
for a railroad with a car attached for two passengers,
with power to ascend an elevation of eighty feet
to a mile. An oval track was constructed for it in a
room. It was opened to the public for exhibition and
several took rides at fifty cents a ticket on the first
"railroad train" ever run successfully in western
America. This was sold to a Mr. Samuel Robb, who
exhibited the novelty at various cities including Louisville,
Nashville, Memphis, and New Orleans; at the
latter place it was burned while on exhibition. In
1837 Mr. Barlow built another locomotive and likewise
sold it to a person who traveled and exhibited it.</p>

<p>The versatile mind of Mr. Barlow also produced a nail
and tack machine, which was at once purchased and
put into use by some capitalists. His rifled cannon,
invented in 1840, patented later, caused Congress
to appropriate three thousand dollars for an experimental
gun, which, when finished and tested, was of
greater accuracy and range than was even expected,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
and which is believed to have suggested most of the
rifled guns since patented in both America and Europe.</p>

<p>The crowning invention of this great genius was his
wonderfully complex production, a planetarium, that
perfectly imitated the motions of the solar system, the
first and only instrument of the kind in the world.
This was so perfected as to produce the minute relative
revolutions of the planets. The first instrument
was sold to Girard College, Philadelphia. A number
of small ones were later made for colleges and
institutions, and one large one for the Military
Academy at West Point, one for the Naval Academy at
Annapolis, and one for New Orleans.</p>

<p>Some of these brought two thousand dollars each.
One was exhibited at the World's Fair Exhibition,
Paris, France, 1867, as Kentucky's contribution, and
received the highest premium awarded any illustrative
apparatus.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_MAN_WHO_KNEW_ABOUT_BIRDS" id="THE_MAN_WHO_KNEW_ABOUT_BIRDS"></a>THE MAN WHO KNEW ABOUT BIRDS</h2>


<p>Kentucky is noted for her great hunters, Indian
fighters, orators, and statesmen. But there also lived
in this state for awhile&mdash;some of the time at Louisville,
part of the time at Henderson&mdash;a man who knew
more about birds than any one had ever learned before.</p>

<p>This was John James Audubon. He was born in
Louisiana near New Orleans, and lived several years in
France, where he enjoyed every luxury. In after life,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
when he spent many years traveling through the forest,
hunting, and studying the birds,&mdash;their homes and
their habits,&mdash;he often went for days and days with
very primitive food. He said his first recollections
were of his home in the South, where he would
lie among the flowers and listen to the songs of the
mocking birds. While yet a boy he gathered birds'
nests, birds' eggs, curious stones, and moss. He would
kill and stuff the birds; but these failed to satisfy him,
as their plumage was not bright like that of the live
birds. So he began to make <i>pictures</i> of the birds
instead. This was done many, many times before
he was satisfied, for he wanted lifelike pictures of his
feathered friends.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/ill-0148.jpg" width="300" height="480" alt="John James Audubon." title="" />
<span class="caption">John James Audubon.</span>
</div>

<p>He married a young lady in Pennsylvania, and
brought her down the Ohio in a flat-bottomed float
called an ark,&mdash;a rather tiresome method for a wedding
trip.</p>

<p>He entered into business in Louisville with bright
prospects, but hunting and studying birds had more
fascination for Audubon than trade. Finally, competition
becoming too strong, he and his partner shipped
their goods to Henderson or Hendersonville; but business
not being good, and the roving instinct strong,
the stay was brief, and Audubon made another change.</p>

<p>A few years later he returned to Henderson when he,
with several partners, attempted to operate a steam
mill; but the place was not suitable, every one concerned
lost his money, and Audubon departed with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
only his sick wife, gun, drawings, and dog. Still he
never despaired.</p>

<p>Audubon spent most of his time in Kentucky,
rambling in the wilds, and persons in both Louisville
and Henderson have
often spoken of seeing
him come in with his
great quota of game.
He said Kentucky was a
"sort of promised land
for all sorts of wandering
adventurers."</p>

<p>While Audubon enjoyed,
to the fullest,
studying his favorite
subject, birds, yet there
were many difficulties
to encounter and many
deprivations to undergo.
He had to travel
many thousand miles,
sometimes using the
breasts of wild turkeys
for bread and bear's grease for butter, sometimes living
on only fruits and roots, sometimes having to quit this
enchanting work for a while and turn dancing master
or artist to procure funds.</p>

<p>After Audubon had traveled, studied, written, and
made many hundred drawings, rats got into his box<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
and cut up all his papers; for a while he was almost
heartbroken and could scarcely eat or sleep. Finally,
with true courage, he said, "I will make more drawings
and make them better than any the rats cut up."
So he persevered and, with the aid of his wife, who
encouraged and inspired him in his great work, and
gladly gave of her salary as a teacher to defray expenses,
he at last went to Europe to arrange for its publication.</p>

<p>He was made a member of the Royal Society at
Edinburgh, concerning which he wrote his faithful wife,
"So, poor Audubon, if not rich, thou wilt be honored
at least and held in high esteem among men." In
another letter he said, "I have run the gantlet of
Europe and may be proud of two things,&mdash;I am
considered the first ornithological painter and the first
practical naturalist of America." His "Birds of
America" contains pictures of one thousand sixty-five
birds, natural size. His work has been called the "most
magnificent monument that has been erected to ornithology,"
and all over our land Audubon Societies have
been formed to protect our friends in feathers.</p>

<h2><a name="A_HERO_OF_HONOR" id="A_HERO_OF_HONOR"></a>A HERO OF HONOR</h2>


<p>It takes neither the excitement of war nor the
curious conditions of the far Orient to prove a man
a hero of the highest type. Martial music, the roar
of the cannon, the thud of the musket, and the flash
of the saber have inspired many men to deeds of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
valor. We find incontrovertible evidence of this in
every battle's record. These are accepted as facts
with no fancy interwoven. But when we read of how
Damon offered to stay in the place of his friend, Pythias,
condemned to death, with the knowledge that if Pythias
did not return by the hour appointed for the execution,
he, himself, would be called upon to make the sacrifice;
how he prayed that his friend would fail to come, but
how that friend, by every conceivable plan, purposely
came in time to accept his fate,&mdash;we sometimes wonder
if any friendship could withstand such a test or any
person's pledge be held in such exalted estimation.</p>

<p>In the early days of Kentucky, when the shrill
whistle of the locomotive had not yet reverberated
among the hills, when the red schoolhouse was not
found in every locality, nor the moonlight schools had
wiped out illiteracy among the mountaineers, there
dwelt in Lewis County a man by the name of Larkin
Liles. He was the hardy son of a hardy race, who
hunted and trapped, lived and loved; and while he
knew not a letter of the alphabet, had never attended
school a day in his life, nor heard the golden rule, yet
his rugged honesty and high sense of honor can never
be surpassed. The "benevolent qualities of head and
heart by a primeval decree are not dependent on education,
for although it enlightens and enlarges the
mind of man, it does not always ennoble it." So this
man, versed in naught but the backwoodsman's lore,
gave the world a lesson in honor.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>On one occasion, when at Vanceburg in the above-named
county, and while under the influence of whiskey,
he became involved in a rough-and-tumble fight with
very serious results. For this offense he was tried,
found guilty, and sentenced to serve one year in the
penitentiary. It so happened that the sheriff of Lewis
County at this time was a personal friend of "Jay-bird"
Liles, and knew the soul of honor hidden by this
rough exterior.</p>

<p>After leaving the courtroom, the prisoner, in a voice
husky with emotion, said, "Uncle Buck,"&mdash;everyone
called the sheriff of Lewis County by this title,&mdash;"Uncle
Buck, won't you let me go home and get in
my winter's wood and fix to have my corn crap gathered,
to fatten my hogs, to keep the young-uns on? Then
I's come over to Clarksburg and go with ye to the
penitentiary."</p>

<p>Sheriff Parker asked, "How long will it take ye,
Jay-bird?"</p>

<p>"About two weeks," he replied.</p>

<p>Then the magnanimity of the man shone forth,&mdash;some
might say overcame the discretion of the
officer,&mdash;when the sheriff replied, "Go ahead and do
it." But so well did he know the pride with which
"Jay-bird" Liles kept a promise, that he was as confident
of his return at the promised time, as was Damon
that Pythias would return.</p>

<p>The wood was cut, an arrangement was made concerning
the crop, the good-by kiss was given to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
weeping wife and helpless babes, and, feeling he was
going on such a distant trip that he would never again
return, Larkin Liles, just two weeks to the day and
hour from the time of the above conversation, walked
into the sheriff's office ready to be taken to Frankfort.</p>

<p>When he told "Uncle Buck" that he was ready to
start, the sheriff shook his hand and told him to spend
the night with him, and on the morrow they would
take the boat for Maysville, and from there go by
stage to Lexington, and on to Frankfort. Again
"Jay-bird's" voice trembled as he thought of the
disgrace of being publicly taken by the sheriff to the
penitentiary; and again he made a most singular request.
"Say, Uncle Buck, I'd rather not do it. You
go that way; but let me take my gun and walk through
the mountains to Frankfort, won't ye? I'd rather do
that, and maybe I might kill some game on the road.
I'll meet you on any spot, on any day you appoint."</p>

<p>What do you suppose the sheriff replied? Looking
him straight in the eye he answered, "All right, Jay-bird,
suit yourself. Frankfort lies right in yon direction;
you can't miss it. When you reach Frankfort,
go straight to the governor's office and tell him what
you are there for, if I don't get there first."</p>

<p>Then this rugged mountaineer, this unlettered, unpolished
son of the hills, with honor as his watchword,
dressed in the primitive style of the time and place,
with his trusty rifle, started over the hills, through
vales, and across streams to meet the sheriff at Frankfort,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
one hundred and fifty miles away, where he would
hear the lock snap as it closed the door that would
shut him in from freedom and friends.</p>

<p>Early one June morning, two days later, before the
people of Frankfort were abroad, a tall, gaunt, determined-looking
backwoodsman, in buckskin clothes
and a coonskin cap, looking as if he belonged to the
days of Daniel Boone, made his way to the governor's
mansion and quietly seated himself on a stone. As
Governor Clark started from the mansion after breakfast,
he was astonished to see this man of the mountains,
who quickly inquired, "Say, Mister, be you the
governor?"</p>

<p>"Yes, my man, I am the governor. What can I
do for you?"</p>

<p>"Well, Governor, my name is Larkin Liles, and I
come up here from Lewis County to get into the
penitentiary for one year. Hed you saw anything
of Buck Parker?"</p>

<p>Utterly astounded, Governor Clark asked, "Who is
Buck Parker?"</p>

<p>"Why, Buck Parker is the high sheriff of Lewis
County, Kaintucky. I thought everybody knowed
that. We all call him 'Uncle Buck' Parker. He was
to come by stage and meet me here. I walked
through."</p>

<p>While Governor Clark was eying him and trying
to realize that such unheard-of proceedings had actually
happened, "Jay-bird" said anxiously, "Say, Governor,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
the sheriff ain't here yit, and I don't want to lose no
time. Can't you let me into the penitentiary and
tell Buck Parker whar he can find me when he
comes?"</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 531px;">
<img src="images/ill-0154.jpg" width="531" height="660" alt="&quot;Well, Governor, my name is Larkin Liles.&quot;" title="" />
<span class="caption">&quot;Well, Governor, my name is Larkin Liles.&quot;</span>
</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>More astonished than ever, Governor Clark said,
"Have you had your breakfast, Mr. Liles?"</p>

<p>With a shake of the head, "Jay-bird" said that he
had traveled all night and upon reaching the city had
come straight to the governor. The governor at
once took him in, gave him his breakfast, and told
him to go over to the capitol, until he could learn
more about the case.</p>

<p>Ten hours later, the sheriff came by stage and soon
found "Jay-bird" at the governor's office. When
the sheriff introduced himself to Governor Clark, the
governor immediately asked if it was a fact that this
man, condemned to a year of confinement and hard
work in the penitentiary, had trudged on foot alone
all the way from Lewis County. When told it was just
as "Jay-bird" had said, the governor, in amazement,
asked, "Is the man crazy? Couldn't he have escaped?"</p>

<p>"Easily, and all the sheriffs, constables, and rewards
could never have caught him. No, 'Jay-bird' is not
simple; he is only honest." The governor was so
interested he asked for all the details.</p>

<p>Then "Uncle Buck" told of the fight, the trial, and
the conviction, of how "Jay-bird" had kept his word
when permitted to go to say good-by to his loved
ones, of his long life of honesty and hospitality, and
of how he had begged to come alone on foot to Frankfort,
rather than as a common, convicted felon.</p>

<p>With a heart heaving with emotion and eyes dim
with tears, the executive hastily affixed his name<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
and the seal of the commonwealth to a small piece of
paper, and, handing it to Larkin Liles, said in a husky
voice, "Mr. Liles, go home to your family and kiss the
little ones for me. You shall never enter the penitentiary
while Clark is governor of Kentucky."</p>

<p>It is eminently proper that the metropolis of "Jackson's
Purchase" should bear a name of Indian origin.
Although the greater part of Kentucky, with its fertile
meadowlands, towering forests, and tangled cane-brakes,
was only the hunting ground of the red men,
yet all that territory in Kentucky and Tennessee lying
between the Tennessee and Mississippi rivers was
the home of the Chickasaw Indians. This large
tribe had their main town at Chickasaw Bluffs, where
Memphis now stands, with a number of other settlements
scattered throughout this seven million acres of
fertile lands.</p>

<p>As Kentucky was once a part of Virginia, and as
the "Old Dominion" was a British colony, this section
was once claimed by Great Britain. After the Revolutionary
War, Virginia, relying on the former policy of
the mother country, that,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>
<p>allowed George Rogers Clark, in recognition of his
services in the Northwest Territory, to enter several
thousand acres of land, including the present site of
the capital of McCracken County.</p>

<p>At that time there were no white settlements in this
section; but as early as the year 1806 or 1807 there
was a flatboat landing and woodyard at the mouth of
the Tennessee River, kept by a genial Irishman named
Pat Dugan. The first name given the place, and the
one by which it was known for many years, was Pekin.</p>

<p>On October 19, 1818, through Governor Isaac Shelby
and General Andrew Jackson, commissioners, the
United States bought from the Chickasaw Indians
their tract referred to above, which in the present
state of Kentucky includes the counties of Ballard,
Calloway, Carlisle, Fulton, Graves, Hickman, Marshall,
and McCracken.</p>

<p>For many years the hero of Kaskasia, Cahokia, and
Vincennes had been infirm and poor. We all remember
the touching scene when the Virginia commission
presented him a sword in recognition of his great services
to the United States; the old soldier listened in
gloomy silence for a while and, finally, thrusting the
sword into the ground and breaking it, he exclaimed,
"When Virginia needed a sword I found one. Now I
want bread!" By the treaty just mentioned the title
of George Rogers Clark was made clear, but as he had
died a few months previous to this his tract passed
to his brother, General William Clark, of St. Louis,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
who had accompanied Meriwether Lewis on the noted
Lewis and Clark Expedition.</p>

<p>A few years after, General William Clark came to the
little town of Pekin accompanied by an Indian chief
who had become a friend of his while on his Western
trip.</p>

<p>In Jefferson's "Notes on Virginia," he speaks of a
tribe of Indians called "Paducahs." In the "Handbook
of American Indians" we find that the "Paducahs"
belonged to the warlike Comanches, this being the name
given them by the Spaniards. There is in Texas a
small town of about one thousand five hundred inhabitants,
named Paducah from this tribe of Indians.</p>

<p>Paducah, Kentucky, is named, not from the tribe, but
from an individual Indian. In his diary of the Lewis
and Clark Expedition, General William Clark speaks
more than once of the kindness shown his party by a
scattered branch of the Paducahs, and of how their
chief became his friend. Dr. Catlin tells, in speaking
of the tribes of the West, of a chief of the Mandans,
Indians that often intermarried with the Comanches,
named "Paducheyeh," meaning "tall or upstanding
chestnut tree." Whether or not he was the one who
became the friend of General Clark we do not know,
but when the Comanches came southward, their old
chief, called Paducah, went to St. Louis, and then
came with General Clark on a visit to the town of
Pekin, where he died with fever, and was buried near
Third Street just beyond Tennessee.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>A log cabin was placed around his grave, and pioneer
residents have told of a party of Indians coming from
beyond the Mississippi and holding ceremonies over
Paducah's grave. These were Comanches, or to use
their tribal name, Paducahs.</p>

<p>Whether the individual name of the old chief who
had befriended General Clark was one of the many
varied spellings of Paducah, or whether General Clark
called him by his tribal name instead, we know not.
Yet there was a real chief in recognition of whose
kindness the "Pride of the Pennyrile" was named
Paducah.</p>

<h2><a name="LUCY_JEFFERSON_LEWIS" id="LUCY_JEFFERSON_LEWIS"></a>LUCY JEFFERSON LEWIS</h2>


<p>As travelers on the waters of "La Belle Rivière"
pass between the historic town of Smithland and the
unpretentious hamlet of Birdsville, few are aware
that they are within a mile or two of the grave of a
younger sister of the writer of our Magna Charta.</p>

<p>Though Lucy Jefferson Lewis was the sister of the
man to whom we owe our American decimal coinage
system, our statute for religious freedom, our
Declaration of Independence, the University of Virginia,
and the Democratic party; though she was the
wife of Dr. Charles L. Lewis, brother of the noted
Meriwether Lewis; and though she was blessed with
wealth, culture, love, and family; yet to-day she sleeps
in an unmarked grave in Livingston County.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>Filled with enthusiasm for the then far West, the
Lewis family, in 1808, ten years after Livingston
County was formed, moved to Kentucky, purchased a
tract of land about three miles from Smithland, and
on a lonely, rocky hill overlooking the beautiful Ohio,
raised their rooftree, and with their Virginia slaves,
began a home in the wilderness.</p>

<p>Some say that Dr. Lewis came with his wife,
children, and servants; others, that he did not
come until eight or nine months after the family
arrived. Be that as it may, all agree that he was
unsociable and moody, and that he soon tired of
his primitive abode and left, they supposed, for his
former Virginia home. All alone with her children
and servants in the Western wilds, is it any marvel
that Lucy Jefferson Lewis should sigh for the happy
home of her youth?</p>

<p>On a lonely, rocky promontory, where she could gaze
far up the river, she would sit day after day, straining
her eyes to see if there might be a "broadhorn" coming
with news from her dearly beloved Virginia.
If one was spied, a servant was at once sent out in a
small boat to bring to her the long-wished-for papers.
But this rare Virginia flower did not long survive
transplantation, and in 1811 she was buried near her
new home, with only a rough stone from the hillside
to mark her last resting place.</p>

<p>Only a few short months afterward, there was enacted
by two of her sons, Lilburn and Isham, a most revolting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
tragedy. Then Lilburn died and it is said Isham,
under an assumed name, entered the volunteer army
and fell at the battle of New Orleans, January 8, 1815.</p>

<p>The other son and three daughters left on file, in
the county clerk's office at Smithland, a writing dated
August 29, 1814, conferring upon Thomas Jefferson
the power of attorney to recover certain lands for them
in Albemarle County, Virginia. They subsequently
married, moved into other states, and nothing is left
to mark the homestead but a pile of rocks. Three
sunken places, overgrown with the wild wood, show
the last resting place of Lucy Jefferson Lewis, her
son Lilburn, and his wife, while the cold autumnal
winds, sighing through the treetops, chant a sad
requiem above the lonely, deserted spot.</p>

<p>Kentucky, rich in minerals, fertile soil, varied
forests, and diversified products, is also a land where
Nature has been lavish with her curiosities.</p>

<p>Some of the most important natural curiosities are
the following: In Boone County there is Split Hill,
where a deep zigzag path of great extent has been
formed; in Breckinridge County there is Sinking
Creek, a stream so large and powerful that it drives
machinery the entire year; at a point about six miles
from its source it disappears and shows no trace for
more than five miles, when it reappears and flows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
into the Ohio. As early as 1847, a Mr. Huston utilized,
for a mill erected on this stream, a natural dam of
rock, eight feet in height and forty feet in width.</p>

<p>In Carter County there are also two smaller streams
that flow for some distance underground. In the
same county, in early days, there was an artesian well
that threw up a jet, about the size of a barrel, to a
height of four feet.</p>

<p>Christian County contains also some sinking streams,
forks of Little River, beside Pilot Rock, which rests
upon elevated ground, has a comparatively level
summit, covers about one half acre of ground, and is
about two hundred feet high. This county also contains
a natural bridge, which crosses a deep ravine
with an artistic arch of sixty feet, and is thirty feet in
height.</p>

<p>Picturesque falls, ninety feet high, are found in
Clinton County, while "Rock House," forty feet high
and about sixty feet square, is located in Cumberland.</p>

<p>In Edmonson County, besides the wonderful Mammoth
Cave, there is "Dismal Rock," almost perpendicular
and one hundred and sixty-three feet high.</p>

<p>In Grant County, for many years an object of great
curiosity, was an immense poplar tree, nine feet in
diameter; it is said a man on horseback, after it lay
prostrate, could barely touch the top of the trunk
with the tips of his fingers.</p>

<p>A natural fortification, a circular tableland, from
fifty to one hundred and twenty-five feet high, impossible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
of ascent except in one place, is an object of
great interest in Hancock County.</p>

<p>In Jessamine County, amid awful grandeur and
gloom, the Devil's Pulpit is found, with a total elevation
of three hundred feet.</p>

<p>In Lincoln County the Knobs, some with a base one
hundred and fifty yards in diameter, two hundred
feet high, and entirely destitute of vegetation, attract
great attention.</p>

<p>Mantel Rock, or Natural Bridge, in Livingston
County, in picturesqueness rivals the far-famed Natural
Bridge of Virginia. This rock, resting against the
hillside, is eight and three fourths feet thick and twenty
feet wide; its arch spans two hundred and twenty feet.
One of the paintings that attracted most attention in
the Kentucky building at the St. Louis World's Fair
was the artistic reproduction of this picturesque place
by Mrs. Georgia McGrew Edwards.</p>

<p>In Lyon County, near Eddyville, 1848, several men
explored a cavern for half a mile, where a large stream
of water, an underground river, was found to be flowing.</p>

<p>About three miles from Benton, in Marshall County,
on a high hill, there is a lake about sixty yards in
diameter, whose depth is unknown; its waters neither
rise nor fall, but stand about fifty feet above the bed
of the creek below.</p>

<p>In Meade County, between Salt River and Sinking
Creek, are several knobs and groves that the pioneers
used as points of observation from which to detect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
the movements of the Indian parties just after they
crossed to the south side of the Ohio River.</p>

<p>Bardstown, in Nelson County, is built on an elevation
under which is a natural tunnel, several feet in diameter,
of circular form, reaching from the eastern to the western
extremity of the eminence.</p>

<p>Owen County has several objects of interest, among
them being Point of Rocks, about seventy-five feet
high, overhanging Deep Hole, whose depth has never
been ascertained.</p>

<p>In Rockcastle County, Bee Cliff rears its summit
three hundred and fifty-five feet above the river; there
are also a number of saltpeter caves where large quantities
of saltpeter were manufactured during the War
of 1812. The largest, called Great Saltpeter Cave,
with its many rooms, some of which cover an area of
several acres, with its subterranean river and weird
grandeur, is a rival in all respects but size to the noted
Mammoth Cave of Edmonson County. The Fall
Cliffs, at some points three hundred feet in height, are
unsurpassed in grandeur.</p>

<p>Among the places of interest in Union County there
is, standing upon level bottom land, a rock two feet
thick, twenty feet wide, and fifty feet high which, on
account of its spur resembling the horn of an anvil,
is called Anvil Rock. In the same county a large
flat rock, deeply indented with impressions of the
human foot of various sizes as well as the distinct
footprints of the dog is found.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p>In Warren County, Wolf Sink, one hundred and fifty
feet wide by three hundred feet long and in depth
varying from twenty feet on the south side to one
hundred and fifty feet on the north side, is an interesting
place.</p>

<p>The Cumberland River in its passage through Whitley
County has a perpendicular fall of more than
sixty feet, forming Cumberland Falls, a picturesque
cascade, the roar of which can be heard sometimes for
more than twelve miles both above and below the
cataract. Behind the sheet of falling water one can
pass nearly across the river bed.</p>

<p>In Edmonson County, near Green River, was discovered
in 1809, by a Mr. Hutchins, while in pursuit
of a wounded bear, that matchless subterranean
palace,&mdash;the Mammoth Cave.</p>

<p>It consists, not of one chamber, but of many magnificent
rooms, winding avenues, towering domes, bottomless
pits, picturesque cataracts, mystic rivers,
gloomy seas, and crystal lakes, on five different levels.
Geologists agree that this immense cavern was carved
out of the limestone ages ago, by both the mechanical
and chemical action of the water. Viewing
the huge columns that have been formed by depositing
the almost infinitesimal amount of lime dissolved from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>

span of time required for this marvelous work.</p>

<p>Here no ray of sunshine lights up the darkness;
here no sound breaks the silence; here no seasons
come and go; here no living creature&mdash;save the
torpid bat, the sluggish lizard, the silent cricket, the
shy rabbit-like rat, and eyeless fish&mdash;exists.</p>

<p>Among the many picturesque spots in this cave
are the Bridal Altar, formed of several pillars grouped
into arches; the Old Arm Chair, in which Jenny Lind
once sat and sang; the Giant's Coffin, a massive stone,
forty feet long, twenty feet wide, and nine feet thick,
that fell, ages ago, from above; Audubon Avenue; the
Bat Chamber, where thousands of bats spend the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>

and white as if made by a master hand; the Devil's
Arm Chair, a large stalagmite in which is a comfortable
seat; Napoleon's Breast Works; Lover's Leap, and
Gatewood's Dining Table; Fat Man's Misery, River
Hall, and Bacon Chamber, the last looking like a part
of a pork-packing house; the Dead Sea, the Corkscrew,
the Holy Sepulcher, Martha Washington's
Statue, Shelby's Dome; the rivers Lethe, Echo, and

<h2><a name="HOW_REELFOOT_LAKE_WAS_FORMED" id="HOW_REELFOOT_LAKE_WAS_FORMED"></a>HOW REELFOOT LAKE WAS FORMED</h2>


<p>About two o'clock in the morning of December 16,
1811, the inhabitants of southwestern Kentucky,
especially those in Fulton County, were aroused and
alarmed by a most destructive earthquake shock
that shook the Mississippi Valley throughout. It
extended all along the Ohio beyond Pittsburgh,
passed the Alleghenies, and died on the far-away
coast of the Atlantic Ocean.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p>The first sign of the catastrophe was distant, rumbling
sounds, succeeded by continued discharges as of
unnumbered pieces of artillery. Then the earth
rocked, chasms yawned, columns of coal, sand, and
water shot up, while electric flashes, shooting through
the otherwise impenetrable darkness, added horror
to the scene. Twenty-seven distinct shocks were
experienced before dawn. Then shock followed shock,
the land was overshadowed by a dense, black cloud of
vapor to which the light imparted a purplish tinge,
but no sunbeam penetrated the pall that overhung all.</p>

<p>Lakes appeared where hills had been; elevations
of land were found instead of lakes; the land in many
places, miles in extent, was sunk below the level of
the surrounding country. The current of the Mississippi
was driven upstream for several hours, on
account of an elevation in its bed; the waters boiled
up in huge swells and violently tossed the boats thereon;
sandbars gave way; huge trees crashed and disappeared
in the maddening billows; the shores opened
in wide fissures, closed, and threw huge jets of water,
sand, and mud high above the treetops. The water
of the river was changed to a reddish hue, thick with
mud thrown up from its bottom, while the trembling
surface was covered with huge masses of foam.</p>

<p>From this temporary barrier, made by the upheaval
of the bottom and the sinking of the sandbars and
banks, the river rose five or six feet in a few minutes;
then the booming waters with redoubled fury rushed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
forward with resistless power and carried everything
before them. Boats, with horror-struck crews, shot
down the declivity "like arrows from the bow," and
were overwhelmed or wrecked on snags, that had been
thrown up from the bottom of the river, or were carried
down in the vortexes. These shocks continued every
day until December 21, and occasionally until February
of the succeeding year.</p>

<p>It was during this extensive and exciting convulsion
that Reelfoot Lake, in Fulton County, made its first
appearance. This great and singular body of water
was formed by sand, blown out of a chasm opened
by the earthquake, damming the waters of a creek,
which spread over the territory and formed a lake
twenty feet deep, from three fourths to two and a
half miles wide, and seventeen miles long. For many
years the tops of immense trees could be seen in the
water by boatmen as they hunted the waterfowls or
cast line for the fish with which it abounds.</p>

<p>The young republic of the United States tried to
follow the warning of Washington, "Friendship to
all, entangling alliances with none." Although France
had aided us in our struggle for independence, we remained
neutral when war was carried on between her
and England. Although it was said of our President,
that he "could not be kicked into a fight," yet, when our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
commerce was well-nigh destroyed, our sailors taken
from our vessels and forced to serve in the British
navy, and our vessels fired upon by England's, we
followed the policy of two of our most gifted
Southern sons, Clay and Calhoun, and on June 18,
1812, again declared war against Great Britain.</p>

<p>When the call came for volunteers to aid the regular
army, although Kentucky's quota was only five thousand
five hundred men, from mountains and glens,
from field and farm, from bench and bar, from every
walk of life, came her best blood, seven thousand strong,
volunteering their services to their country's cause.</p>

<p>When one thousand five hundred men were required
to join General Hull in his expedition against the
savages, in the Northwest, two thousand answered
the call, only to learn, after crossing the Ohio, that
Hull had cowardly surrendered his army and the
whole of Michigan territory to the British, although
his army numbered nearly double the enemy.</p>

<p>For several months, at various times and places, the
Kentucky troops did special and efficient service.
In January of the succeeding year, Colonel Lewis
with from seven hundred to one thousand Kentuckians,
marched against a combined force of British and
Indians at Frenchtown on the river Raisin, and drove
them from the village. Three days later, General
Winchester was told that a large force of the enemy
was on its way to attack the victors. As the night
was bitter cold, the precaution of stationing pickets<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
was neglected, and early the next morning, two thousand
British and Indians under General Proctor suddenly
attacked the camp. The Kentucky riflemen fought
stubbornly for hours. Their ammunition ran low,
but still they fought. Even when summoned to
surrender they, Spartanlike, preferred death. But,
being promised that their wounded would be safely
guarded and humanely treated, they laid down their
arms. History records how this promise on the part of
Proctor was not kept, how the drunken Indians burned
and tomahawked the helpless men and officers, until
long afterward the rallying cry of the Kentuckians was,
"Remember the river Raisin&mdash;Raisin and Revenge."</p>

<p>At Fort Stephenson, one hundred and sixty men
under Colonel Croghan of Kentucky repulsed Proctor
with nearly four thousand. When the idolized General
Isaac Shelby went at the head of the Kentuckians,
all felt that he would lead them to victory.</p>

<p>It is said that when Commodore Perry wrote, "We
have met the enemy and they are ours," after his
memorable victory on Lake Erie, that one hundred
sharpshooters from Kentucky had aided in the capture.</p>

<p>At the battle of the Thames nearly all the American
troops were Kentuckians, and that gallant soldier,
Colonel Richard M. Johnson, did noble service in the
killing of the noted Tecumseh. When Jackson, barricaded
behind cotton bales at New Orleans, defeated
Pakenham with his veteran forces, more than one fifth
of the American soldiers were Kentucky riflemen.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>Kentuckians, past and present, have ever been
distinguished for their brilliant, persuasive oratory
on the stump, at the bar, or in the forum.</p>

<p>Three of the most eloquent
men our state claimed
in the nineteenth century
were Clay, Marshall, and
Menefee.</p>


<p>Wherever Thomas F.
Marshall, a native of Kentucky,
lifted up his voice,
he entranced all with his
profound logic, flight of
fancy, stinging satire, and
beauty of language. Had
his powers of self-control
been as great as his genius,
learning, and eloquence, no
position in the dizzy heights would have been beyond
his reach. But his brilliancy, his worth, and his work
were all obscured by that dreadful blight, intemperance.
Mr. Marshall's tribute to another orator and
statesman, Richard H. Menefee, is pronounced by all
to be one of the most graceful and eloquent passages
in our literature.</p>

<p>Born in obscurity, rising rapidly by his own energy
and eloquence, at twenty-three Menefee was the commonwealth's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
attorney. At the bar his success was
phenomenal. In the state
legislature and in the United
States Congress, where he
served one term each, he, from
the first, was recognized as
a student and a statesman
surpassed by  none. His
strength of character, his
courage of conviction, his
surpassing eloquence, brought
praise from all. When at
the height of fame, when men
eagerly sought his counsel,
and throngs hung upon his
words, consumption closed his brief but brilliant life in
his thirty-second year.</p>

<h2><a name="KENTUCKIANS_IN_TEXAS_AND_MEXICO" id="KENTUCKIANS_IN_TEXAS_AND_MEXICO"></a>KENTUCKIANS IN TEXAS AND MEXICO</h2>


<p>Among the volunteers that flocked to the support of
Texas when she threw off the yoke of oppression there
were many hundred Kentuckians. However, our state
was not aggressive about the annexation of the new
republic, which all saw might lead to war with Mexico.</p>

<p>After the annexation, General Zachary Taylor, an
adopted Kentuckian, was sent with troops to protect
Texas, and soon war began. When Kentucky called for
thirty companies, one hundred and five were organized.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>At Monterey some of our bravest fell, among them
being Major Philip N. Barbour. General William O.
Butler was among the number severely wounded. In
honor of their bravery on this battlefield, the Kentucky
legislature passed complimentary resolutions on the
Louisville Legion, and presented swords to General Taylor,
General Butler, and the widow of Major Barbour.</p>

<p>At the bloody battle of Buena Vista, where General
Taylor had nearly five thousand men, one fifth of the
troops were from Kentucky. The Mexicans had a
force more than five times the number of the Americans,
still the victory was ours. As the killed and
wounded were eighteen per cent of the enlistment,
Kentucky paid dearly for the glory won.</p>

<p>Among the fallen were Colonel William R. McKee,
Lieutenant Colonel Henry Clay, oldest son of the great
statesman Henry Clay, and Adjutant Vaughn.</p>

<p>When many, who had given their lives for the cause,
were reinterred at Frankfort and a fitting monument
was erected, on it was inscribed this quotation from
the immortal elegy, "The Bivouac of the Dead," by
our soldier-poet, Theodore O'Hara:</p>

<p>In Hanover County, Virginia, April 12, 1777, was
born Henry Clay, the "Millboy of the Slashes," who
in after years became the idol of our state,
and one of the most notable figures in
the entire Union.</p>

<p>Left fatherless at the age of five
years, his teaching and training
devolved upon his mother. So
well did she perform her part that
much of her illustrious
son's greatness may rightfully
be ascribed to maternal
influence.</p>

<p>At the early age of
twenty-one Henry Clay became
a member of the bar at Lexington,
and it was not long before his
genius, his eloquence, and his
versatile powers made for
him a name that will
ever endure.</p>

<p>He served with marked success in the United States
Senate; his great genius, his high patriotism, his
boundless energy, and fiery eloquence so swayed the
people that more than once civil war for a time was
averted, sections were reconciled, and he won the title
of the "Great Pacificator."</p>

<p>Convinced of his duty, Henry Clay was conscientious
in discharging it, and when he thus lost the highest

words, "I would rather be right than be President."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>He did not need this office to confer honor on him;
he would have conferred honor on the office.</p>

<p>His fame was world-wide. His service as a statesman,
his power as an orator, his courage as an antagonist,
his cogency of reasoning, his untiring efforts as a
peacemaker, spread from ocean to ocean and even
beyond the seas. When he was laid to rest at his
beloved Ashland, high potentates, distinguished persons,
and the great common people alike bowed their
heads.</p>

THE STATES</h2>


<p>From Kentucky cabin homes came the two men
who were destined to be the political leaders in the
greatest conflict that ever shook our continent.</p>

<p>In 1808, Jefferson Davis, who became the President
and idol of the Confederacy, first saw the light in that
part of Christian County that was afterwards erected
into Todd.</p>

<p>In 1809, Abraham Lincoln, the war President of the
United States, was born in that part of Hardin County
that afterwards became Larue.</p>

<p>The gifted Kentuckian, Henry Clay, had by his
pacific measures postponed war, but it was not to be
averted. When it came, our governor, Beriah Magoffin,
attempted neutrality, and refused to raise troops
for either army. From many homes, however, went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
soldiers to each side; friend was arrayed against
friend, brother against brother, and father against
son. The hour of patriotism, danger, and privation
had come. When the first gun in the war was fired
at Fort Sumter, South Carolina, a native Kentuckian,
Major Robert Anderson of the United States army,
commanded the garrison.</p>

<p>On our soil both Confederate and Federal forces
were raised. Various towns were occupied and fortified
by soldiers, at some places under the Stars and
Bars, at other places under the Stars and Stripes.</p>

<p>The boys that wore the gray entered Kentucky and
fortified themselves at Columbus and Hickman under
Major General Leonidas Polk, and at Cumberland
Gap under General Zollicoffer. The boys in blue,
acting under orders from Brigadier General U.S. Grant,
invaded the state at Paducah.</p>

<p>General Albert Sidney Johnston of Kentucky took
command of the Confederate "Central Army of Kentucky,"
and under his orders General Simon B. Buckner
fortified Bowling Green.</p>

<p>At Wildcat Mountain, near London, a bloody conflict
took place, General Zollicoffer leading the
Confederates, and Colonel T.T. Garrard and General
Schoepff the Federals. The Confederates, being outnumbered,
withdrew, after a loss to each side.</p>

<p>At Sacramento, Colonel Forrest defeated a company
of Federals two days after Christmas, 1861.</p>

<p>Early the next year General Zollicoffer and General<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
George B. Crittenden encountered General Thomas
at Mill Springs; reënforcements came to the Federals,
the gallant Zollicoffer fell, and the Confederates were
forced to retreat.</p>

<p>At Big Hill, in Rockcastle County, the Federals
were defeated; at Richmond the Confederates were
again victorious, while at Munfordville they were
repulsed.</p>

<p>At Augusta a bloody battle between Colonel Basil
Duke's men and the home guards under Dr. Joshua T.
Bradford resulted in another victory for the Confederates.</p>

<p>In the severe battle of Perryville, where 25,000
Federals, under General A. McCook, met 16,000 Confederates
under General William J. Hardee, the Federal
loss was more than four
thousand and the Confederate,
one thousand less. This
was one of the most desperately
contested battles of the
war.</p>

<p>That daring Confederate
cavalryman, General John
H. Morgan, the "Francis
Marion" of the Confederacy,
captured Glasgow, Elizabethtown,
and the blockhouses
at Muldraugh's Hill, where he tore up the railroad
track. Colonel Cluke defeated the Federals at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
Mount Sterling, destroyed railway trains, and captured
supplies.</p>

<p>At Bardstown, Maysville, Tompkinsville, Cynthiana,
and Paducah, the two sides met in deadly conflict.
At the latter place the daring Confederate cavalryman,
General Nathan Bedford Forrest, entered with his
troops. Here also General A.P. Thompson, while
gallantly leading his troops in a charge on Fort Anderson,
fell pierced by a cannon ball.</p>

<p>At Murfreesboro, Missionary Ridge, Chickamauga,
Vicksburg, Donelson, Shiloh, Baton Rouge, Stone
River, indeed, on almost every battlefield, Kentucky
courage was tested and never found wanting.</p>

<p>At the close of the crucial conflict more than thirty
thousand of the flower of our Kentucky manhood had
fallen, and thousands more were crippled.</p>

<p>More than forty thousand Kentuckians followed the
fortunes of the Confederacy. Among them were:
General Albert Sidney Johnston; Lieutenant Generals
Simon B. Buckner and John B. Hood; Major Generals
John C. Breckinridge, William Preston, and George B.
Crittenden; Brigadier Generals John Hunt Morgan,
Humphrey Marshall, Ben Hardin Helm, Basil W. Duke,
Roger W. Hanson, Lloyd Tilghman, John S. Williams,
George B. Hodge, Thomas H. Taylor, Henry B. Lyon,
Adam R. Johnson, and Richard S. Gano.</p>

<p>More than one hundred thousand of the white men
of our state and eleven thousand negroes enlisted in
the Federal cause. Among the former were numbered:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
Major Generals Thomas L. Crittenden, Cassius M.
Clay, Don Carlos Buell, William Nelson, Lovell H.

Major Generals Robert Anderson, Richard W. Johnson,
Stephen G. Burbridge, W.T. Ward, Walter C.
Whittaker, John T. Croxton, and Eli Long; Brigadier
Generals James M. Shackelford, James S. Jackson,
Green Clay Smith, Speed S. Fry, Jerry T. Boyle,
Edward H. Hobson, T.T. Garrard, L.P. Watkins, and
W.P. Sanders.</p>

<p>Of the Kentuckians engaged we can truly say no
braver men were found on either side; no better citizens
have helped to develop our state since the conflict
closed. Now only a few veterans are left on either side.

<p>When a baby is christened we at once wonder why
it was so named, especially if the name be a new or odd
one. When we hear a new name for an invention we
begin to look up the etymology of the word to see why
it is so called. So it is with places, for there is a reason
for their names being what they are. Take the beautiful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
capital of the blue-grass section of our state, and
we find an interesting romance concerning its origin.
In the year 1775, when</p>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i3">"The first oath of Freedom's gun<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Came on the blast from Lexington,"<br /></span>
</div></div>


<p>a party of hunters, while in camp on one of the branches
of the Elkhorn, learned that the first battle between the
British and Americans had taken place. To commemorate
the important event they called the place of their
encampment Lexington. William McConnell, Francis
McConnell, Alex McClelland, John McClelland, David
Perry, and Charles Lecompt came down the Ohio in a
large canoe as far as the mouth of the Kentucky,
thence up that stream to the Elkhorn region, where
they explored and made some improvements, between
April and June of 1775.</p>

<p>Another party&mdash;Joseph Lindsay, William Lindsay,
Patrick Jordan, Garret Jordan, and John Vance&mdash;explored
the country and made some improvements in
the vicinity of the present site of Lexington, and Joseph
Lindsay, here, at the spring, built an "improver's
cabin" and raised the first corn and beans in that
country.</p>

<p>Lexington was not permanently settled until a few
years later, by Colonel Robert Patterson and others.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1773 two parties from Virginia
came down the Ohio River to explore the rich lands of
Kentucky. One of these made the first survey and
settlement at what is now the metropolis of our state.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
In August, Captain Thomas Bullitt laid off a town at
this site, which was occasionally visited by different
persons. No permanent settlement was made until
in the spring of 1778, when General George Rogers
Clark brought a few families and left them on an island
near the Kentucky shore, which was called Corn Island
from the circumstance that the settlers raised their first
Indian corn there. In the fall of the same year, after
Clark had captured the British posts that had served
as the fountain head for the Indian incursions, the
settlers felt more secure and removed from the island
to the mainland. In 1780 the legislature of Virginia
passed an act to establish the town of Louisville at
the Falls of the Ohio, naming it in honor of Louis XVI
of France, whose troops were at that time aiding the
Americans in their fight for liberty.</p>

<p>In 1780, on the Kentucky River, where our capital
now stands, a party, among whom was Stephen Frank,
on their way from Bryan's Station to the fort at Lexington
to secure salt, encamped and were attacked by the
Indians. Two were wounded, and Frank instantly
killed. In memory of Frank the place was ever after
called Frankfort.</p>

<p>Covington was named in honor of General Leonard
Covington, who distinguished himself at Fort Recovery,
1749. The name of Colonel Richard Henderson,
the head of the Transylvania Company, is perpetuated
in Henderson, or, as it was formerly known,
Hendersonville. Bowling Green, denoting a plat for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
bowling, probably came from the name found in
Yorkshire, England.</p>

<p>Hopkinsville perpetuates the name of the Revolutionary
hero, General Samuel Hopkins. Owensboro
was named in honor of Colonel Abraham Owen, who
fell at Tippecanoe. Ashland gained its name from the
vast amount of ash timber in that region. Maysville
bears the name of its founder, John May. Georgetown
and Washington both took their names from our
first President.</p>

<p>The first part of Mount Sterling was named from
the many mounds in the vicinity, the latter from a
city in Scotland. Richmond was named for a city in
Virginia, and Shelbyville for our first governor. Smithland
was named for Captain James Smith, the first
white man to explore that region. Catlettsburg and
Danville were called respectively from their founders,
Horatio Catlett and Walker Daniel. Lebanon, with
its abundance of cedar trees, was named for the mountain
in Palestine, where such trees abound.</p>

<p>Paris, from the city in France, Versailles, from the
royal palace in that city, and Glasgow, from a city in
Scotland, bear transatlantic names. Eminence from
its elevated position, and Eddyville from the eddies
in the Cumberland River near there, bear names
descriptive of the places. Kuttawa, or Cuttawa, the
red man's first name for the Kentucky River, is the
only town in the state, besides Paducah, bearing an
Indian name. Carrollton, from Charles Carroll, Franklin,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
from the great philosopher, Ludlow, from Israel
Ludlow, and Princeton, from William Prince, its first
settler, perpetuate names noted in history, science,
and frontier days.</p>

<p>Cynthiana, for Cynthia and Anna, daughters of the
proprietor, and Elizabethtown, for the wife of Colonel
John Hardin, are the only towns in the state named for
women.</p>

<p>Morganfield, for General Daniel Morgan, Nicholasville,
for Colonel George Nichols, and Greenville, for
General Nathanael Greene, commemorate, respectively,
three Revolutionary officers. Bardstown, Campbellsville,
Flemingsburg, and Hawesville perpetuate the
names of their founders, David Baird, Adam Campbell,
John Fleming, and Richard Hawes, respectively.
Berea is from the ancient city in Macedonia, Columbus
from the great navigator, and Lancaster from a town
in Pennsylvania; Adairville and Morehead from two
former governors, Governor John Adair and Governor
James Morehead. Captain Paschal Hickman, Honorable
John L. Murray, Colonel T.D. Owings, and the
Wickliffes are remembered respectively by the towns
of Hickman, Murray, Owingsville, and Wickliffe.</p>

<p>Elsewhere, we have spoken of Kentucky inventors,
and also given a sketch of the great ornithologist,
John James Audubon. We are indebted for facts
about prehistoric Kentucky to "Ancient History or
Annals of Kentucky" published as an introduction to
Marshall's "History of Kentucky," by the eccentric
naturalist, C.S. Rafinesque. Though born in Constantinople,
he spent seven years as professor of the
natural sciences, and of the French, Spanish, and
Italian languages in Transylvania University in Lexington.
It was Rafinesque who, amid all the privations of
pioneer traveling, explored Kentucky in the early part
of the nineteenth century, from Greenup on the east
to McCracken County on the west. He covered nearly
the entire area of the blue grass, and also included in
his itinerary the remote counties, Adair, Clay, Harlan,
Perry, Pulaski, and Rockcastle, and located one
hundred and forty-eight sites and five hundred and five
ancient remains or monuments of the Mound Builders.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<p>Audubon tells of his first meeting with this great
antiquarian, whose dress, if not fashionable, was at
least remarkable. He wore, says Audubon, "a long,
loose coat of yellow nankeen which hung loosely about
him like a sack, much the worse for the many rubs it
had got in its time and stained all over with the juice
of plants. A waistcoat of the same,
with enormous pockets, reached over
a pair of tight pantaloons, the lower
part of which was buttoned down to
the ankles." In this attire, with a
bundle of dried plants on his back,
Rafinesque accidentally approached
Audubon and asked where the noted
naturalist lived. Upon learning it was
the great Audubon to whom he was
speaking, Rafinesque handed him a
letter of introduction in which the
writer recommended an "odd fish"
which might not have been described in any published
treatise. Audubon at once asked to be shown the
"odd fish," but soon realized that Rafinesque answered
to that name. It was during this visit, that, in his excitement
to secure a new species of bat, Rafinesque
demolished Audubon's favorite violin. His versatility,
his energy, and his achievements stamp him as one of
the most remarkable of men in many lines of thought
and activity.</p>



<p>In the field of medical science, also, Kentucky in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
both past and present has been noted. In 1806,
Doctor Brashear of Bardstown successfully performed
an amputation at the hip joint, the first operation of
the kind in the United States. In 1809, Doctor
Ephraim McDowell of Danville performed one which
was the first of its kind in the world, and of which
Doctor Gross in his "Lives of Eminent American Physicians
and Surgeons of the Nineteenth Century" says,
"Had McDowell lived in France, he would have been
elected a member of the Royal Academy of Surgery,
received from the king the cross of the Legion of Honor,
and obtained from the government a magnificent reward
as an acknowledgment of the services rendered his
country, his profession, and his fellow creatures."</p>

<h2><a name="BESSEMER_STEEL_IN_KENTUCKY" id="BESSEMER_STEEL_IN_KENTUCKY"></a>"BESSEMER STEEL" IN KENTUCKY</h2>


<p>One most important invention or discovery of the
nineteenth century was made by William Kelly, who
came from Pittsburgh and located near Eddyville, in
Lyon County, in 1846. Here he operated both the
Union and the Suwanee furnaces, mostly by slave labor,
until he conceived the plan of using Chinese workers,
which he secured through a New York tea house. As
these Celestials, with their pigtails, were the first in
this section, they created a great deal of curiosity.
Mr. Kelly, having a special knowledge of chemistry
and metallurgy, investigated and experimented in the
manufacture of iron, and concluded that the crude metal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
could be converted into steel without fuel; that by
placing the fluid metal in a suitable furnace and forcing
powerful blasts of air through the molten mass, he
could produce the desired result.</p>

<p>His veteran forgemen could not conceive of metal
being "boiled" by simply blowing air through it, for
it had been their experience that air blown over its
surface chilled it. They knew nothing of the affinity
of oxygen with carbon for producing heat; they had
always consumed quantities of charcoal to secure this
greater heat; they had buried bars of wrought iron in
charcoal in a furnace, where, the air being shut off, the
charcoal was slowly burned for two or more weeks.
Then the product was taken out and melted, forming
"cast steel." So they were completely surprised when
forcing the currents of air through the mass of iron
intensified it to incandescence and refined the metal.</p>

<p>The experiment was made in 1851 and used by Mr.
Kelly advantageously for many years. Being almost
isolated in practically a wilderness, thirty miles from
even the nearest country press, the inventor failed to
advertise and take proper advantage of his invention.
In 1855, however, many of the steamboats plying the
Ohio River were using boiler plates made from iron
prepared by "Kelly's air-boiling process." The next
year Henry Bessemer, an iron manufacturer of England,
took out a patent for this pneumatic process, to
which his name has been given; but, although Mr.
Kelly was delayed in securing his patent by his attorney,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
when the claim was heard by the commissioner of
the Patent Office in this country, it was decided that
Mr. Kelly was the inventor and his patent was at once
granted. For many years Mr. Kelly received a royalty
on his interest in the inventions. In time the patents
of Kelly, Bessemer, and Mushet were combined.
Prior to this discovery, steel cost five times as much
as iron; now steel rails, wearing four times as long as
iron, cost only a few dollars more per ton. Thus we
see the incalculable importance of another Kentucky
invention, for now steel is made directly from pig iron
in about thirty minutes, instead of as formerly in almost
as many days.</p>

<h2><a name="KENTUCKY_ARTISTS" id="KENTUCKY_ARTISTS"></a>KENTUCKY ARTISTS</h2>


<p>While Kentucky's sons and daughters have enriched
the field of science by inventions and discoveries, they
have not neglected the fine arts.</p>

<p>Among the painters, Matthew H. Jouett of Mercer
County from early childhood displayed a talent by
drawing sketches with a lead pencil. He became a
pupil of Gilbert Stuart, who always called him "Kentucky."
Jouett, on the occasion of La Fayette's
visit, painted the noted general, and from that sketch
painted the life-sized one that hangs in the State
House. His pictures were on exhibition at the World's
Fair at Chicago and compared favorably with those of
the best foreign painters. It is said that Thomas S.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
Noble, another native of Kentucky who has won fame
with his brush, exclaimed after viewing Jouett's portraits,
"Rembrandt is next to God and Jouett is next to
Rembrandt." The Honorable Charles Summers, who
had made a study of foreign artists, on seeing one of
Jouett's portraits,
examined it closely
and exclaimed,
"What a glorious
Van Dyck!" Richard
Jouett Menefee
made a catalogue
a few years ago of
three hundred and
thirty-four paintings
by his grandfather.</p>

</div>

<p>In Frankfort was
born another boy,
Joseph H. Bush,
whose talents at an
early age caused
him to use his mother's hearth and a piece of charcoal
to sketch a profile of his father. Among his noted
works are portraits of General Zachary Taylor, Benjamin
W. Dudley, and Governor John Adair.</p>

<p>John Grimes, who lived many years in this state, is
noted for a portrait, "The Country Lad," and "Suicide,"
a composition. Oliver Frazer first saw the light<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
in Fayette County. He studied under Jouett and
Thomas Sully, and later at Paris, Florence, Berlin,
and Ludlow, where he and P.R. Healy, fellow students,
became fast friends.</p>

<p>Though he was born in Pennsylvania, so much of the
work of Louis Morgan was done in Kentucky that we
class him with her artists. His "Simon Kenton" was
the most prominent picture at an exhibition in the
Academy of Fine Arts at Philadelphia.</p>

<p>As a boy, Samuel W. Price also exhibited artistic
talent; among his portraits being "Old King Solomon"
and one of Chief Justice George Robertson. Among
his works in composition are "Caught Napping" and
"Gone Up." There are also W.C. Allen, Mrs. Eliza
Brown, Aaron H. Corwine, Paul Sawyier, Nevill Cain,
and others who have done creditable work.</p>

<p>The poet-sculptor, Joel T. Hart, when only five
years old modeled figures of animals in clay, molded a
button out of pewter, and carved in wood. His first
work of note was a bust from life of General Cassius
M. Clay; among other noted men of whom he made
busts were General Andrew Jackson, the Honorable John
H. Crittenden, Robert Wickliffe, and the Reverend
Alexander Campbell. His statue of Henry Clay now
stands on the capitol grounds at Richmond. Louisville
and New Orleans each ordered a statue of Clay.
After that came Hart's masterpiece, "Woman Triumphant,"
which stood for years at Lexington, Kentucky.</p>

<p>The Kentucky legislature appropriated twelve hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
dollars for removing the remains of Joel T. Hart
from Florence, Italy, and reinterring them at Frankfort.</p>

<p>Although born in California, Mrs. Mary Anderson
de Navarro, an artist in another line, spent her girlhood
in Louisville, so Kentuckians have ever claimed
her as "Our Mary." Her brilliant stage career is known
to all.</p>

<p>Whether we write of the hardy pioneer facing
danger and privation, of the volunteer soldier freely
offering up his life on the altar of his country, of the
great general leading his men to victory, of the mature-minded
statesman helping to guide the ship of state, or
of the brilliant orator swaying thousands by his eloquence,
we find Kentuckians in every rôle. Likewise
we find the skillful surgeon severing the diseased<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
part from that aglow with health, the learned lawyer
tactfully pleading his client's cause, the able heads
of our government discharging well their duty, the
learned judge of our highest court presiding with wisdom
and justice, and the consul to foreign countries
shedding luster upon the post he holds. Again we note
the scholarly heads of universities training the youth of
the land, the sound business man striving for a better
city, the patriot answering in any form his country's
call, the great naturalist finding the many secrets of
mother Nature, the historian cautiously collecting
data and describing important incidents, and the sweet
singer bringing cheer into every place. Further we find
the humorist bringing smiles to every face, the consecrated
minister leading thousands to a new life, the inventor
bringing comfort and ease, and the artist skillfully
using his brush or chisel to imitate Nature. Indeed,
the roll call of eminent Kentuckians will show that
they have played such important parts in both military
and civil affairs that one or more, and often many,
Kentuckians have filled each of these posts with credit
to themselves and glory to their state.</p>

<p>None have been found braver, none more brilliant,
and none more beloved, whether serving in their native
or their adopted state.</p>

<p>More than eighty have represented us in foreign
countries; more than fifty have been governors in
other states; more than thirty have been United
States senators from other states; and more than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
eighty have been representatives in Congress from
other states.</p>

<p>Scanning the pages of our national history, you will
find the names of Henry Clay, Zachary Taylor, Jefferson
Davis, Abraham Lincoln, John C. Breckinridge,
Linn Boyd, John G. Carlisle, Adlai Stevenson, Thomas
Corwin, Isaac Shelby, John M. Harlan, Ninian Edwards,
Roger Q. Mills, and hundreds of others of the
native or adopted sons of our commonwealth. Without
their worth and works many chapters could not have
been written, many policies could not have been perfected,
and many victories could not have been won.</p>

permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be

things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See

individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with

keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the

     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days

Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
